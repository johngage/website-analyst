I’ve tried to explain a few times the danger of a too-weak shelter in place, and mentioned that this may cause a “saddle” in cases. Here is a more detailed explanation.



ESTIMATE FROM WUHAN



After Wuhan the statisticians estimated that R0 was still > 1 with people sheltering in place, as in this curve fit from Wuhan where strategies were changed quickly—

OUR TRANSITION FROM UNCONSTRAINED TO SHELTER IN PLACE WAS/IS SLOWER AND WEAKER



We didn’t do such a sharp transition to shelter in place as Wuhan. Gov. Cuomo “closed the valve” slowly. We widely did a multi-step reduction of the number of people who “should" gather. We rolled out restrictions gradually geographically.



Further, in the West our shelter in places are weaker than Wuhan. People aren’t wearing masks which increases R0. Thankfully we are (very belatedly) getting past the preposterous lies about masks, but the “use them” message isn’t loud enough or mandatory (because, again, we are not prepared). We also aren’t segregating people with symptoms away from their families, having contacts shelter in place, using flu tests and blood tests and radiology to stretch our limited testing supplies, etc.



THE SUM OF TWO CURVES



So if, as the statisticians suggest, R0 is still greater than 1 for us even with shelter in place, then might we observe?



The initial unconstrained community spread will create a peak of cases spread in such a manner, as shown in the thin blue first peak below.



After we make a transition to shelter-in-place the number of such community spread cases will fall away. In the graph below I assuming we could somehow count those unconstrained community spread cases, and separately show the cases the curve from a second mode of transmission from “family spread”—people in sheltering families infecting each other, and also such families cross-infecting other families as they interact in “central locations” such as stores. This second curve, with a lower R0, begins as we begin the transition to shelter-in-place. It has a much lower slope up from the beginning of shelter-in-place, but is as yet unconstrained if R0 still >1.



This simple simulation [https://www.​youtube.com/watch?v=​gxAaO2rsdIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs) explains why the central location “store spread" effect is so very strong, and the lack of general wearing of even simple masks and the pernicious lie about their necessity for individuals, amplified by the asymptomatic carrier problem can have such a strong impact.

A SADDLE



The reason I wrote this note is because I haven’t seen discussed the saddle that we may see.



In countries in Asia which killed the first wave we are worried a second separate wave can start. But in the US because of our weak and slow and leaky shelter-in-place we have an additional possibility—that the R0 is still substantially > 1, perhaps as high as seasonal influenza, and thus will have two overlapping curves, resulting in an observed “saddle” as above.



The exact shape of these curves depends on the relative R0’s and I also note that there is still some relatively unconstrained spread in the workers for essential services who while they may be doing some physical distancing aren’t e.g. wearing masks or provided with adequate other protections, essentially a fractional version of the first wave. (Aside—it is in this population, e.g. the NYC first responders, who lack adequate protection, that we will probably see the first glimpses of herd immunity, which will, eventually if they aren’t further protected, die away in that subgroup from herd immunity there.)



I hope the saddle does not happen, that R0 < 1 with our shelter in place, but that may well not be the case. If R0 is still >1 and we get a saddle it will be discouraging and confusing but should not be surprising.



CONCLUSION



We should now, but certainly if a saddle emerges, need to do what they did in Wuhan, with a tighter shelter-in-place, wearing of masks, and segregating infectious people and their families. All this is enabled by much more availability of testing or use of other screening measures to stretch testing resources, as will certainly be necessary in other geographies say India).



We also need to prepare, after we flatten the curve or “bend the saddle”, led by the military, for the large logistic effort to do what was done in Korea (as in the note below).



You go to war with the tools you have. We have limited tools. We aren’t using them well and aren’t prepared, emotionally, for the range of possible outcomes, including the possibility of a “saddle”.
