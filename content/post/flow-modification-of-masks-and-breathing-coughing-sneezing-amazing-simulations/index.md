Received this today through a reliable source… the author Jean-Michel Claverie, according to Google, is

> an Emeritus full Professor of Genomics and Bioinformatics at the School of Medicine of Aix-Marseille University in the Structural and Genomic Information Laboratory, a unit of the French National Research Center (CNRS) that he founded in 1995.

These show, in particular, that sneezing into your elbow vs. hand seems to have very different outcomes.

> **Why wearing masks (even handcrafted ones)?**\
> In the controversy surrounding the usefulness of wearing a mask to stem the CoViD-19 epidemic, it is very irritating to see the “experts” and the medical world base their discourse only on the capacity of FILTRATION of the masks ("FFP2", surgical, ..., etc.). The "particle" of SarS-CoV-2 (the virus) is a sphere with an approximate diameter of 125 nanometers, or 0.125 micron. It is obvious that the manufacture of masks impermeable to objects that small (10 times smaller than most bacteria) but allowing respiration requires sophisticated ​industrial processes.\

> BUT the hygienic and social interest of wearing a mask is NOT due to its microbiological quality (its ability to stop each particle), but to its ability to modify the flow of air exhaled through the mouth (when we cough and speak) and through the nose (when you breathe or sneeze). This is a FLUID MECHANICS problem, not one of microbiology. The superb Utube video below illustrates better than a long speech the effect of wearing a mask:\

> In addition to redirecting the air flow, a mask, whatever its nature will also serve to protect its wearer by mopping up the famous “droplets” carrying viruses that could reach it (from the inside and from the outside).\
> \
> In summary, masks capable of stopping virus particles are only necessary in an atmosphere in which particles constantly float (eg emergency rooms), which is fortunately not the case in the air we breathe when we go shopping. As far as social life is concerned, making sure that the air flow exhaled by our neighbor (possibly carrying the virus) does not reach us, must be our main concern. The best solution for this, is that he wears a mask even very handcrafted. And as long as we don't know if we are carrying the virus ourselves (in the absence of a test), we owe him reciprocity, and therefore wear one too.\
