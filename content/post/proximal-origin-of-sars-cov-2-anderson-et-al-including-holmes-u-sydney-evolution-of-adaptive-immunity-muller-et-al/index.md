The popular press is printing stories about the possible origin of SARS-CoV-2.\
> [https://www.dailytelegraph.com​.au/coronavirus/bombshell-doss​ier-lays-out-case-against-chin​ese-bat-virus-program/news-​story/55add857058731c9c71c0e96​ad17da60](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/coronavirus/bombshell-dossier-lays-out-case-against-chinese-bat-virus-program/news-story/55add857058731c9c71c0e96ad17da60)\
Given that the question of the origin of the virus is now in the popular press, in no small part for political reasons,\
I thought I would share some relevant scientific material which may be of interest.\
\
I had started to look at the end of March at the implications for vaccines of viral evolution and came across some material about RNA virus evolution and the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 which I never shared widely and have not seen quoted or referred to in the major news sources.\
\
In searching vaccines and possible evolution of the virus away from them I came across this book--\
>> The Evolution and Emergence of RNA Viruses (Oxford Series in Ecology and Evolution) 1st Edition\
> [https://www.amazon.com/gp/prod​uct/B002ZCZ344](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZCZ344) by Edward C Holmes, now Professor at the University Sydney

This led me to look on Holmes’s website at U Sydney where I found this paper, which was published on/before April 1 (when I first wrote of it)--\
> The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2\
> [https://www.sydney.edu.au/mari​e-bashir-institute/news-and-​events/news/2020/03/24/the-​proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2.​html](https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/news-and-events/news/2020/03/24/the-proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2.html)\

which says in its conclusions\
> the evidence shows that SARS- CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus.\
> it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here.\
[which other theories are—\
> 1. Natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer.\
> 2. Natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\
> 3. Selection during passage.]

\
> However, since we observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features,  including the optimized RBD and polybasic cleavage site, in related coronaviruses in nature, we do not believe that any type of laboratory- based scenario is plausible.\
\
The conclusion also includes the following:\
>>it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the pandemic matter.\
> Detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively\
> will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species,\
> then there is the risk of future re-emergence events.\
> In contrast, if the adaptive process occurred in humans,\
> then even if repeated zoonotic transfers occur, they are unlikely to take off without the same series of mutations.\
That is, the question of whether the virus crossed once and evolved, or could cross many times (like MERS) seems important.\
This is not unrelated to the discontinuance of bat research programs, as we would prefer not to create bat reservoirs\
of the virus e.g. in case 2 (or in additional infected bat species in case 1),\
and also not unrelated to whether the virus might find reservoirs, perhaps asymptomatic, in other mammals (e.g. pets).

Since writing the above I also found a very interesting paper\
> An evolutionary perspective on the systems of adaptive immunity\
> [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.co​m/doi/epdf/10.1111/brv.12355](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/brv.12355)\
attached as a pdf for convenience, second below, which describes\
> an evolutionary perspective to classify and characterize\
> the diverse systems of adaptive immunity that have been discovered across all major domains of life\
and specifically\
> We put forward a new function-based classification according to the way information is acquired by the immune systems:\
> \[1] Darwinian immunity (currently known from, but not necessarily limited to, vertebrates)\
> relies on the Darwinian process of clonal selection to ‘learn’ by cumulative trial-and-error feedback;\
> \[2] Lamarckian immunity uses templated targeting (guided adaptation) to internalize heritable information on potential threats;\
> \[3] finally, shotgun immunity operates through somatic mechanisms of variable targeting without feedback\
and\
> We argue that the origin of Darwinian (but not Lamarckian or shotgun) immunity represents a radical innovation in the evolution of individuality and complexity, and propose to add it to the list of major evolutionary transitions.

A fascinating read and framework.\

> I’d like to be optimistic too, but a durable vaccine-induced immune response may be beyond early 21st century science, because our immune system doesn’t provide it.\

[there are other issues such as vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility see e.g.\
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p​ubmed/19022319](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022319)\
and recent difficulties with Dengvaxia e.g.\

\
