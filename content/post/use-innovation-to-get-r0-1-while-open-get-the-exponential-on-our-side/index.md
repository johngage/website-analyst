We are in for a long fight against COVID\
whose R0 has now been estimated (by Los Alamos, preprint at CDC website) to be about 6,\
"Los Alamos Estimates R0 of 5.7 (95%CI 3.8-8.9) High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of COVID19"\
[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/arti​cle/26/7/20-0282_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article)\
about twice what I had previously seen.\
\
This confirms that if we are “open” we are likely to have R0 \*\*substantially\*\* above 1,\
which will lead to more outbreaks, and thus\
will spend a lot of time shut or have hospital chaos and wide spread\
as a Fed governor said over the weekend.\

\
Let’s look past the next few weeks to the war ahead,\
to the war we must fight against the virus and to keep our economy open\
while we don’t have a vaccine.\
We can only win if we can be open with R0 < 1 or at least R0 \~\~1.\
To see the effect of different R0’s look at the various countries on the Imperial College site—\
[https://imperialcollegelondon.​github.io/covid19estimates/#/d​etails/Italy](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/covid19estimates/#/details/Italy)\
That is Italy, where R0 estimated just < 1 now; it is painfully slow to get the numbers down.\
Look also at Sweden to see a runaway, and Greece which has R0 smaller.\
Recall Wuhan was estimated during the cordon sanitaire (and more) to be 0.3.\
\
I believe we need innovation to have substantial openness and R0 < 1, to think out of the box.\
It’s likely we can’t get there with just the tools we have today, COVID may be just too infectious;\
it’s even possible that R0 > 1 even now with shelter-in-place—the Wuhan data suggests it might.\
I hope not but if it was it would be hidden behind the huge wave that preceded it\
and not necessarily visible to the models which are bottom-up tracking the data we are seeing.\
\
Thus for the war, not the current battle, we need new weapons against COVID.\
There are two innovations which I believe can help if we can commercialize them quickly.\
\
1) We should aspire to make reusable masks using e.g. the Ionic Materials polymer\
(there may be other polymers which are suitable also)\
and give them to every person, in a size that fitsm which they can clean in a microwave\
or by boiling if they don’t have a microwave.\
We would also give everyone simple wraparound (prescription as necessary) goggles too.\
\
With luck these masks might be able to be N99 (99%) rather than N95.\
We are doing basic feasibility now and trying find support to try to do this super quickly.\
This would substantially reduce R0 providing hospital grade protection or better.\
We could use the early such masks as tools to squash hot spots,\
and in subpopulations which are essential workers to both protect them and cut the spread.\
\
2) We should aspire to make a breath test machine that is very very fast to detect asymptomatics.\
A breathalyzer for COVID rather than Alcohol.\
Something like this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p​mc/articles/PMC5298772/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5298772/)\
or as proposed in Israel and elsewhere.\
\
The first innovation effectively increases the distance between us as we are in the world,\
because it intercepts the virus with the kind of efficiency like for doctors and nurses etc in hospitals.\
The second helps us catch the troubling asymptomatics which are otherwise a terrible problem.\
\
Of course we should also do widespread temperature testing,\
and have people quarantine in hotels or tent hospitals or whatever\
that will reduce r0 also, but not below 1 while we are open.\
We of course needs lots of contact tracing and this will help R0, but also not\
enough if we are open as we will be overwhelmed with community spread.\
\
Such masks and asymptomatics would be the equivalent, in this war,\
of technologies like radar and cracking the Nazi cryptography,\
innovations which helped us turn the tide and win WW2 in air and at sea.\
\
I hope there are other protection complementary innovations that can reduce R0\
without requiring shelter-in-place\
so we can be more open and have a chance of R0 < 1\
while we hope for a vaccine.\
Every bit of R0 reduction helps, but we need some big things to win.\
