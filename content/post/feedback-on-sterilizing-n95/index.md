I had written, about 2 weeks ago that we should look at the possibility of reuse of PPE, specifically N95s--

> 1) N95’s can be UV-C’s or Microwaved (or probably treated with Ozone) and reused see this report from NIH.\
> Don’t know why this isn’t talked about more or if hospitals know this.\
> Published by Oxford University Press 2009.\

I received today feedback that the above study addressed the structure of the materials surviving treatment.\
That is quite important as if the small pores in the material were damaged or clogged then presumably\
the material would not function mechanically and was my point in forwarding it.

I had assumed that many mechanisms known to kill viruses could be used if mechanical properties were preserved.\
\
I didn’t intend to imply this settled the sterilization aspect, which would best be tested separately\
and specifically for COVID, which testing had not, to my knowledge, then been done,\
but which any competent laboratory with access to materials could test.

I now share a number of other ideas related to the sterilization aspect.

I have not independently verified any of the ideas I am here sharing but the breadth of them

suggests that those with access to testing might help enormously by vetting some of these for emergency use.\

**MORE ABOUT MICROWAVES AND STERILIZATION**\
Here is a link with references to this [https://regenexx.com/​blog/coronavirus-episode-12-​does-a-microwave-kill-​coronavirus/](https://regenexx.com/blog/coronavirus-episode-12-does-a-microwave-kill-coronavirus/)

There are many other materials readily available. I do not believe this is controversial, but should be specifically tested for time,

power temperature achieved etc. See paper “JUST RECEIVED TESTING WITH COVID” below.

\
**USING CONVENTIONAL OVENS**\
Here is a story about using an oven temperature only for this \
[https://iheartintelligence.​com/stanford-researchers-n95-​masks-sterilized-reused-low-​temperature-heating/](https://iheartintelligence.com/stanford-researchers-n95-masks-sterilized-reused-low-temperature-heating/)\
Structural integrity would need to be checked.\
\
**USING UV**\
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/​03/20/health/coronavirus-​masks-reuse.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-masks-reuse.html)\
This is shown by the original study to leave structure of N95’s intact.\
\
**USING OZONE**\
An innovator in Aspen Colorado is testing using an ozone generator.

With this you could conceivably fill a room with various protective gear\
perhaps including gowns and the like and thereby sterilize them in bulk.\
if the polymers are ozone-stable this should work, but all the polymers would have to be checked for such stability.

This is perhaps the most large-scale technique possible.\
\
PS JUST RECEIVED TESTING WITH COVID\
[https://www.medrxiv.org/​content/10.1101/2020.03.15.​20036673v1.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036673v1.full.pdf)\
Some take aways--\
COVID Killed by 70C heat for 1 minute (158F).\
Surgical masks seem quite a happy place for the virus.\
Hope someone tests COVID steriliation by UV-C and Ozone and the like.

> **USING SCUBA GEAR**

2) Larry Brilliant wrote in a Wired interview that N95’s only cut the risk by 5x.

This means that nurses and doctor’s are still exposed and in a long slog we’ll see problems like in Italy.

So why not get a recreational SCUBA tank and regulator, plug your nose\
with swimming plugs and protect your eyes e.g. with swimming goggles\
or better a full face diving mask with two-way radio.

If you need to communicate you might have to write on a slate,\
but this should cut the infection rate to near 0 as you aren’t breathing filtered but known clean air.



This requires quite some logistics, and there are certainly gear that is used

in biosafe facilities, but the problem I am addressing here is availability—

that biosafe PPE may be in short supply; the diving gear supply in cities is separately available,

COTS (commercial off the shelf).

It might be used, in particular, in the most high risk situations,

e.g. by people who are doing cleaning and intubations who are at extremely high risk.

\
Full face scuba masks with 2-way communication equipment built in should be easily obtainable or manufacturable.\
[https://www.divein.com/guide/​dive-equipment/full-face-​diving-mask/](https://www.divein.com/guide/dive-equipment/full-face-diving-mask/)\
You also don’t need to wear a full scuba tank, you can use a “pony bottle”\
[https://www.leisurepro.com/p-​aqutp13/catalina-pony-bottle-​tanks-yellow-with-pro-valve-​13-cu?gclid=​Cj0KCQjw09HzBRDrARIsAG60GP\_​NchjGazUDMOaBPB2ZJSpS0K0U7eoVz​9esPArFcna\_​fmVANEqSs7UaAhysEALw_wcB&​gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.leisurepro.com/p-aqutp13/catalina-pony-bottle-tanks-yellow-with-pro-valve-13-cu?gclid=Cj0KCQjw09HzBRDrARIsAG60GP_NchjGazUDMOaBPB2ZJSpS0K0U7eoVz9esPArFcna_fmVANEqSs7UaAhysEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)\
You need a small compressor to refill them, most dive shops would have one, not complicated many suppliers.\
Should be more dive shops than hospitals in many locations.





Hope this helps.



Best, Bill
