Received this today through a reliable source… the author Jean-Michel Claverie, according to Google, is

> an Emeritus full Professor of Genomics and Bioinformatics at the School of Medicine of Aix-Marseille University in the Structural and Genomic Information Laboratory, a unit of the French National Research Center (CNRS) that he founded in 1995.

which is (sometimes) followed on youtube by several other interesting simulations (which if not are linked below)

These show, in particular, that sneezing into your elbow vs. hand seems to have very different outcomes!
