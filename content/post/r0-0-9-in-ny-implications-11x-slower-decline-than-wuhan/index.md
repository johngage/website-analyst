Cuomo/NY State on TV just now estimated R0 (Rt) at \~\~0.9 with stay in place…\
This is disheartening, because as he said they have almost no margin for opening up without it going > 1\
(he put up a limit of 1.2 as the upper bound of the margin he had).\
\
So the NE alliance of states extended stay-at-home until May 15 which is certainly necessary,\
but the numbers won’t decline very fast with a 0.9 constant.\
\
Now requiring simple masks may help reduce this 0.9 slightly,\
but of course Wuhan was estimated to have \~\~1.21 with stay at home and mask wearing\
before they started the most aggressive measures on Feb 3.\
\
With this estimate and the separately communicated estimate of 1.4 from Seattle late March\
I previously communicated,\
and with the realistic inability to separate people from their families and\
force contacts of such people to widespread isolate eg in hotels\
we can see how important additional NPI’s such as better masks will be to getting R0 << 1,\
and even more important in healthcare- and resource- limited environments like in other parts of the world.\
\
It was very nice to see Cuomo put up a slide which included that Wuhan was 0.3\
(from Feb 3, when they did the segregation of people and the fever tents).\
That we have not adopted more of the techniques from Wuhan\
(temperature testing, isolation of the sick and their contacts (even if voluntary) which allowed this low R0 is tragic.\
That they showed us that 0.3 is possible and we have achieved, apparently, only \~\~0.9 is tragic.\
\
The process of getting to open in Wuhan lasted, if memory serves, 79 days, the majority of it at 0.3.\
0.9^11=0.31, i.e. it takes 11 times as long at a rate of .9 to get the same result as at 0.3.\
Unimaginably long, but that’s what the data says.\
\
Without substantial additional NPI measures, at R0 0.9, New York, and we all, have a long road ahead.\
