This morning’s paper brings a public argument for some of what was done in Wuhan that we have not been doing\
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/0​4/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart​-quarantine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart-quarantine.html)\
called “smart quarantine” in this article.\
The discussion in this OpEd is incomplete and lacks numbers, hence this email which also brings\
some hopefully useful new metaphors.\
\
THE ROGUE WAVE FROM +33% / DAY\
\
When COVID-19 arrived in most places\
and without any serious mitigation measures\
we widely saw +33%/day numbers doubling every 2.6 days+-.\
Until we put (even weak) shelter-in-place into effect, this growth created a huge “rogue wave” of cases\
at different times in different geographies.\
\
A TRANSITION TO WEAK-SHELTER IN PLACE CAUSES THE ROGUE WAVE TO BREAK\
\
With us now having, as was done very briefly in Wuhan (before Feb 3), a weak shelter-in-place,\
the +33%/day rate will quickly be replaced with a lower growth rate,\
causing this +33% wave to, after a delay, break\
as I observed in the note yesterday.\
At the moment we are observing today the initial decline from this wave breaking with much excitement.\
We seem to be mistaking this, much as someone not understanding a hurricane\
could mistake the passing of the eye overhead, for a coming “all clear”. It is anything but.\
\
R0 WITH WEAK SHELTER IN PLACE COULD BE ABOUT THE SAME AS INFLUENZA...\
\
The doubling time will soon be dominated by spreading from our weak shelter-in-place, with a lower R0.\
The R0 estimate from early shelter-in-place (before Feb 3) in Wuhan was estimated by statisticians to be 1.21.\
R0 is probably generally now higher in the United States than in this period in Wuhan because we haven’t, for example,\
been wearing simple masks as now finally recommended by CDC,\
and because we have neither a national shelter in place (see FL and LA), nor as good compliance (see parks in NYC).\
\
BUT AN INFLUENZA WHICH HAS BEEN SEEDED EVERYWHERE...\
\
The effect of the weak-shelter-in place R0 being > 1 can be understood by analogy to influenza\
to which the R0 for COVID-19 in the United States is currently possibly comparable perhaps 1.3 or 1.4.\
With such an R0 we would still see spreading such as we see with the flu,\
but rising up in many areas simultaneously since the rogue wave left cases everywhere see e.g.\
[https://www.nytimes.com/intera​ctive/2020/04/03/us/coronaviru​s-county-epidemics.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-county-epidemics.html)\
\
AND AN INFLUENZA-LIKE R0 WOULD THEN MAKE AN EVERYWHERE RISING FLOOD\
\
The effect of an influenza like spread, starting everywhere, would be like floodwaters rising everywhere.\
Think Houston with the massive rainfall.\
While the Rogue Wave of COVID-19 was initially limited to be larger in locales with more travel and urban settings,\
the virus is now too widespread for us to get a substantial geographic delay in such flooding.\
Instead the rise of cases from weak shelter-in-place can occur now pretty much everywhere until R0 < 1,\
and really dissipate quickly (if quickly is 2 months as in Wuhan) only with stronger controls and R0 << 1\
starting from when the quarantine is strong enough to start the time with this low R0.\
\
“SMART QUARANTINE” IS ONLY PART OF "WHAT WORKED IN WUHAN"\
\
The Times article this morning “The United States Needs a Smart Quarantine)\
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/0​4/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart​-quarantine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart-quarantine.html)\
describes only part of what we need to do to get R0 << 1.\
This step of isolating the people who are sick or may be is one key difference in what was done in Wuhan\
where before Feb 3 with a weaker measures R0 was estimated to be 1.21 vs after stronger measures estimated 0.3.\
\
What were some key differences between before Feb 3 and after?\
Of course, segregating people who are or might be sick, which is what “smart quarantine” is proposing.\
But Wuhan also did widespread temperature testing, and of course everyone was wearing a mask,\
and probably more things. (A good US strategy would start from what was done in Wuhan and be very precautionary\
in leaving anything out. That we lied about and left masks out of our weak shelter-in-place was extremely foolish.)\
\
WHAT IS STILL MISSING AND NEEDED—THERMOMETERS (a PPE- and Ventilator- scale FAIL), ASYMPTOMATIC STRATEGY, MASKS!, ...\
\
We must prepare for widespread temperature testing; this requires ordering vast quantities of contactless thermometers\
and similar scanning equipment. Without this we can’t screen non-compliant people out,\
(We could also use the Kinsa thermometers to help get warning of fevers,\
of great help for the compliant and detecting outbreaks, but they wouldn’t catch the non-compliant.)\
\
That we do not, to my knowledge, have a temperature screening strategy and very very large order\
is as big a fail in my mind as not ordering ventilators and PPE much much earlier\
(or, better, to have stockpiled them and created surge manufacturing capacity sufficient for a pandemic with\
sufficient capacity in supply chains, as was proposed so rightly so long ago e.g. in plans from BARDA and beyond.)\
\
ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS AS NOW UNDERSTOOD MEAN WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN WUHAN\
\
We also need a better strategy for the asymptomatic carriers as they will otherwise dog us as this pestilence\
becomes endemic. These carriers are now known to be a much larger problem than was previously understood in Wuhan.\
This is one area where we must do \*\*much\*\* more than was done in Wuhan.\
As long as the asymptomatic are circulating among us we risk super spreader flareups;\
I do not see, without a highly effective and efficient vaccine,\
how large crowds and restaurants and the like can go back to normal until we can screen these\
unless we accept the substantial risk of such outbreaks.\
(I personally would not take such a risk; I think many people won’t as they thereby put their family and friends at risk.)\
\
THE RISK EVOLUTION OF COVID-2X IMPLORES US TO INVEST IN ASYMPTOMATIC DETECTION\
\
As I (following Ewald) have previously pointed out, the possible more pathogenic evolution of COVID is extremely dangerous.\
A disease which has its own “vector” in the form of asymptomatic carriers who can move among us undetected\
unlimited in range like mosquitoes, say are, has no natural barrier to evolving to be more deadly.\
This makes it even more important that we invest in startup technologies to create a contactless breath-analyzing machine for mass screening\
as these may be even more necessary in the future.\
There was breath-detection work along these lines at SUNY\
and another project is now also proposed in Israel as I have previously mentioned and linked.\
Perhaps there are other ways, other than breath analysis, of detecting the asymptomatic cases early.\
This is worthy of a Manhattan project type approach to look at all possible such ways.\
\
BEYOND ANTIVIRALS AND VACCINES; WHAT WAS DONE IN KOREA\
\
We hope for great therapies. There is even hope we may be able to find some which are broad spectrum,\
which can work against whole classes of viruses e.g. [https://www.newyorker.com/maga​zine/2020/04/13/the-quest-for-​a-pandemic-pill](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/the-quest-for-a-pandemic-pill)\
But we cannot count on such antivirals alone—viruses have had millions of years to evolve and will continue to do so.\
Presented with herd immunity they have a strong incentive to evolve away from it and are likely to do so.\
\
We hope for great vaccines. But we can’t be assured they will come soon or that we can prepare ones so broad\
that they can be to protect against future COVID-2X’s in advance.\
\
We thus need a plan, that works for this and future pandemics, when our tools may be limited.\
In Wuhan, as in war, China marshalled resources to Wuhan, and organized to win with what they had at hand.\
The fever tents didn’t try to test everyone—tests were limited so they used blood work, ordinary flu testing and radiology\
to increase the ability to find sick people given limited resources.\
Our plan should be real about what resources we will have, what compliance we can expect, and work within those constraints.\
\
We also need to implement tracking and tracing as best as possible.\
I would recommend starting with what is being done in Korea—they planned and executed very well.\
I would also look at innovations elsewhere provided they were additive and didn’t retard our rollout,\
especially if they advanced it, as in Estonia and Taiwan, Singapore and other places.\
\
THE CONSEQUENCES OF LIES AND MAGICAL THINKING\
\
We have an infectious information disease, that proceeds from the White House, of saying things that are not true\
and repeating them over and over as a political propaganda strategy to make them believed to be true,\
We have not had the testing we needed. If we don’t and pretend that we do, then we won't make a plan which does the best\
it can with the resources we actually have. Chaos will result. Plans will fail. The outcome will be materially worse.\
\
We have a magical thinking problem, hoping that a single particular unproven cocktail will be a silver bullet.\
Instead of preparing manufacturing for the most promising vaccines and therapies, as Bill Gates have suggested,\
we are distracted by stockpiling of a couple of drugs. I fervently hope hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin work\
and we can find a regime which avoids the cardiac and other dangers. But such hope is not a plan.\
\
Unless we admit that there are many things we may have to make and prepare\
and “risk buy” (e.g. stockpile) the manufacturing capacity for the things we think are most likely to work\
we are not being real—we will greatly then delay the widespread availability of better tools.\
\
LET’S GET REAL!\
\
Without “smart quarantine” and more, while R0 > 1, the floodwaters will rise.\
Such rising can hide for now behind the chaos of the aftermath of the rogue wave, but a flood would be revealed after the wave subsides.\
\
This morning also brings news that New Zealand is also trying to crush its outbreak.\
[https://www.washingtonpost.com​/world/asia_pacific/new-zealan​d-isnt-just-flattening-the-​curve-its-squashing-it/2020/​04/07/6cab3a4a-7822-11ea-a311-​adb1344719a9_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/new-zealand-isnt-just-flattening-the-curve-its-squashing-it/2020/04/07/6cab3a4a-7822-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html)\
If we want to crush our outbreak also, to hope to get to a much better outcome,\
then we need to take the steps needed to start the clock, as Wuhan did on Feb 3, on a strong quarantine, with R0 << 1.\
\
Best, Bill\
\
PS Another analogy, familiar more perhaps to those who live on the ring of fire, would be seismic—\
when an earthquake occurs you often get an early warning from the P-wave [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/​P-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-wave)\
with the main e.g. S-wave part of the quake to follow [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/​S-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-wave)\
This early warning may only be seconds or can be a minute or more.\
In Japan a warning system using these waves may give you a minute or so to take action before the S-wave\
but more before a tsunami which may follow; in either case action needs to be taken quickly!\
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/​Earthquake_Early\_Warning\_(Japa​n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_Early_Warning_(Japan))\
\
We have had many P-wave COVID-19 alerts. So far, in my view, we have ignored them all—waiting for the S-waves or longer to act.\
When you are dealing with exponentials e.g. at +33% a day even a small such delay is as we have seen very very costly.
