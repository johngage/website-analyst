A SECOND STAGE ACCELERATION



This article which just appeared in the NY Times

> "Don’t Be Fooled by America’s Flattening Curve” By Nathaniel Lash\
> [https://www.nytimes.com/​interactive/2020/05/06/​opinion/coronavirus-deaths-​statistics.html?action=click&​module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-deaths-statistics.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage)

shows the kind of “saddle” behavior I previously imagined in the case curves with a second leg up is emerging in the case data from behind the huge peaks from unconstrained/rapid spread in NY, LA, MI, etc. that were otherwise occluding them, which observation emphasizes a concern that we may see a substantially larger number of cases confirmed in the data in say 4-6 weeks.



**THIS WAS PREDICTED BY WUHAN DATA**



This is as was expected from the Wuhan data, available since March, as I had described in an April 6 email,

attached for convenience again below, which email contained this sketch of the effect

a variation of what was seen in Wuhan, this from a Harvard coauthored study from early March—



THIS MAKES STAYING WITHIN HOSPITAL CRITICAL CARE CAPACITY VERY DIFFICULT



This “second stage” acceleration in cases will make it very difficult to get out of community spread and

stay in a contact tracing regime and also importantly to not overload the hospital critical care capacity.

This paper

estimates that we should really stay closed until we have a very low number of active cases

perhaps 5 per 10000 or less before opening up during a contact tracing regime as was discussed in this paper

which paper suggests staying open in such a regime only until we have no more than 35 cases per 10000;

these active cases then read on critical care capacity which we do not want to exceed.

I here assume that the daily cases would need to be 10x less than this to have the active cases being this low

(assuming 10 days in critical care average) and thus take the limits to be 5 and 35 actual new cases per 100,000 daily.

\
With 330m people we would thus hope to get down to 3300*5 =16500 actual new cases per day to open up\
not the probably 100000+ actual new cases per day we are at right now.

Thus, despite 6 weeks or so of shelter-in-place, we are probably still >6x high.

(The confirmed cases are of course only a fraction of the actual cases; this 100k cases is I think conservative for actual.)

The Science paper authors state 35 per 10000 active here translated to be 35 per 100000 new daily cases,

as a threshold to close down, from which at most 35*3300=115,500 daily countrywide new cases can be allowed

to allow the hospital critical care capacity to be sufficient.\
(This is also further discussed in my April 14 email discussing that paper reincluded below.)

\
Thus we should actually be clamping down now rather than opening up,\
to try to bend the daily actual new case count down to 5 per 100000, which bending we have achieved far too weakly.\
\
**HOW MUCH MIGHT REOPENING INCREASE THE CASE COUNT?**\
\
A simple estimate would be that opening up will raise the case count,\
perhaps by 4x over the course of the next 4-6 weeks

(not much in log/Rt space, i.e. only about 4%/day over 5 weeks)

leaving us the 6x above the 4x above \~\~25x above the Science-paper-suggested opening up level,\
and overshooting the shut down level in the Science paper by at least 4x.\
\
A MODEST SUBGROUP COULD MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL ACCELERATION

\
Here’s how 4x+ could easily happen—

Imagine that 15% of the population, a subpopulation of like-minded people,

throws off the restrictions and starts behaving as before—no masks, going to church, etc. mixing (birds of a feather).



If this subgroup then has a doubling rate of a week\
(conservative and allows for more rural, as unconstrained/more urban has been widely seen at \~\~3 days)\
then this subgroup would have, after 5 weeks, 2^5=32x the case count\
it would have had under the status quo ante.

That is (32x-1x)*.15%=4.6x is the whole population delta case count ratio coming from just this subgroup

(assuming the rest of the population is flat)\
even ignoring spillover (“family” or other spread) into other groups which are trying to shelter from this subgroup storm.\
\
WE DIDN’T SHUT DOWN STRONGLY LIKE ITALY AND ELSEWHERE\
\
We never got Rt low enough to see even the slow but sustained kind of decline that Italy and others have seen.

In the future, after the now-expected second leg up,\
the length of time it would take in the kind of weakly-effective slow- to no- decline\
shutdown to slowly get back to a practically traceable level will thus be unimaginably long.



I reattach finally below the simple spreadsheet previously prepared to show the effect of better personal PPE on the reduction of cases and the size of rolling open/closed waves.

\
**WEAK SHUTDOWNS FROM A SECOND LEG UP GIVE NO PRACTICAL PATH TO CRITICAL CASES LOW**\
\
I see no path with current tools (weak shutdowns) from such amped up community spread back to a level

with critical cases low enough to avoid hospital overload and to make contact tracing practical.

We are setting up to leave ourselves no reasonable-time-frame options out of such community spread.\
\
WITH PERSONAL N95-TYPE MASKS THERE MAY BE HOPE\
\
I hope we can find a way to create a substantial supply of personal reusable N95-quality masks for the fall.

This is the stretch and very difficult but not impossible goal we are striving for.

\
Such masks might give us a way to get R0/Rt down enough to get out of an otherwise insane “stuck state” of unabatable community spread we are otherwise likely to be in, because, from the higher level of daily cases we are heading to, shelter in place, as weakly practiced in the US, is too slow a process to get us to the 5 per 10000 active cases for “reopening” implied in the Science paper in any reasonable timeframe.



Until we have a safe and widely available vaccine, which can’t come too soon, and unless we go through the unimaginable hell of crashing forward toward herd immunity, personal high quality PPE is perhaps the only possible path out from the failed-policy path the US is on.

I wish there were more solutions. I don’t know what they are.\
