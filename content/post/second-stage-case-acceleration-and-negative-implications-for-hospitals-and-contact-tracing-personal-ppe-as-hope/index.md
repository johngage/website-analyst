A SECOND STAGE ACCELERATION



This article which just appeared in the NY Times

> "Don’t Be Fooled by America’s Flattening Curve” By Nathaniel Lash\
> [https://www.nytimes.com/​interactive/2020/05/06/​opinion/coronavirus-deaths-​statistics.html?action=click&​module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-deaths-statistics.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage)

shows the kind of “saddle” behavior I previously imagined

in the case curves with a second leg up is emerging in the case data

from behind the huge peaks from unconstrained/rapid spread in NY, LA, MI, etc. that were otherwise occluding them,

which observation emphasizes a concern that we may see a substantially larger number of cases confirmed in the data in say 4-6 weeks.



THIS WAS PREDICTED BY WUHAN DATA



This is as was expected from the Wuhan data, available since March, as I had described in an April 6 email,

attached for convenience again below, which email contained this sketch of the effect

a variation of what was seen in Wuhan, this from a Harvard coauthored study from early March—



THIS MAKES STAYING WITHIN HOSPITAL CRITICAL CARE CAPACITY VERY DIFFICULT



This “second stage” acceleration in cases will make it very difficult to get out of community spread and

stay in a contact tracing regime and also importantly to not overload the hospital critical care capacity.

This paper

> Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV2 through the post-pandemic period.

> [https://science.sciencemag.​org/content/early/2020/04/24/​science.abb5793](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/24/science.abb5793)

estimates that we should really stay closed until we have a very low number of active cases

perhaps 5 per 10000 or less before opening up during a contact tracing regime as was discussed in this paper

which paper suggests staying open in such a regime only until we have no more than 35 cases per 10000;

these active cases then read on critical care capacity which we do not want to exceed.

I here assume that the daily cases would need to be 10x less than this to have the active cases being this low

(assuming 10 days in critical care average) and thus take the limits to be 5 and 35 actual new cases per 100,000 daily.

\
With 330m people we would thus hope to get down to 3300*5 =16500 actual new cases per day to open up\
not the probably 100000+ actual new cases per day we are at right now.

Thus, despite 6 weeks or so of shelter-in-place, we are probably still >6x high.

(The confirmed cases are of course only a fraction of the actual cases; this 100k cases is I think conservative for actual.)

The Science paper authors state 35 per 10000 active here translated to be 35 per 100000 new daily cases,

as a threshold to close down, from which at most 35*3300=115,500 daily countrywide new cases can be allowed

to allow the hospital critical care capacity to be sufficient.\
(This is also further discussed in my April 14 email discussing that paper reincluded below.)

\
Thus we should actually be clamping down now rather than opening up,\
to try to bend the daily actual new case count down to 5 per 100000, which bending we have achieved far too weakly.\
\
HOW MUCH MIGHT REOPENING INCREASE THE CASE COUNT?\
\
A simple estimate would be that opening up will raise the case count,\
perhaps by 4x over the course of the next 4-6 weeks

(not much in log/Rt space, i.e. only about 4%/day over 5 weeks)

leaving us the 6x above the 4x above \~\~25x above the Science-paper-suggested opening up level,\
and overshooting the shut down level in the Science paper by at least 4x.\
\
A MODEST SUBGROUP COULD MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL ACCELERATION

\
Here’s how 4x+ could easily happen—

Imagine that 15% of the population, a subpopulation of like-minded people,

throws off the restrictions and starts behaving as before—no masks, going to church, etc. mixing (birds of a feather).



If this subgroup then has a doubling rate of a week\
(conservative and allows for more rural, as unconstrained/more urban has been widely seen at \~\~3 days)\
then this subgroup would have, after 5 weeks, 2^5=32x the case count\
it would have had under the status quo ante.

That is (32x-1x)*.15%=4.6x is the whole population delta case count ratio coming from just this subgroup

(assuming the rest of the population is flat)\
even ignoring spillover (“family” or other spread) into other groups which are trying to shelter from this subgroup storm.\
\
WE DIDN’T SHUT DOWN STRONGLY LIKE ITALY AND ELSEWHERE\
\
We never got Rt low enough to see even the slow but sustained kind of decline that Italy and others have seen.

In the future, after the now-expected second leg up,\
the length of time it would take in the kind of weakly-effective slow- to no- decline\
shutdown to slowly get back to a practically traceable level will thus be unimaginably long.



I reattach finally below the simple spreadsheet previously prepared to show the effect of better personal PPE

on the reduction of cases and the size of rolling open/closed waves.

\
WEAK SHUTDOWNS FROM A SECOND LEG UP GIVE NO PRACTICAL PATH TO CRITICAL CASES LOW\
\
I see no path with current tools (weak shutdowns) from such amped up community spread back to a level

with critical cases low enough to avoid hospital overload and to make contact tracing practical.

We are setting up to leave ourselves no reasonable-time-frame options out of such community spread.\
\
WITH PERSONAL N95-TYPE MASKS THERE MAY BE HOPE\
\
I hope we can find a way to create a substantial supply of personal reusable N95-quality masks for the fall.

This is the stretch and very difficult but not impossible goal we are striving for.

\
Such masks might give us a way to get R0/Rt down enough to get out of

an otherwise insane “stuck state” of unabatable community spread we are otherwise likely to be in,

because, from the higher level of daily cases we are heading to,

shelter in place, as weakly practiced in the US,

is too slow a process to get us to the 5 per 10000 active cases for “reopening” implied in the Science paper

in any reasonable timeframe.



Until we have a safe and widely available vaccine, which can’t come too soon,

and unless we go through the unimaginable hell of crashing forward toward herd immunity,

personal high quality PPE is perhaps the only possible path out from the failed-policy path the US is on.



I wish there were more solutions. I don’t know what they are.\

Thankfully we are (very belatedly) getting past the preposterous lies about masks, but the “use them” message isn’t loud enough or mandatory (because, again, we are not prepared). We also aren’t segregating people with symptoms away from their families, having contacts shelter in place, using flu tests and blood tests and radiology to stretch our limited testing supplies, etc.\

> After we make a transition to shelter-in-place the number of such community spread cases will fall away. In the graph below I assuming we could somehow count those unconstrained community spread cases, and separately show the cases the curve from a second mode of transmission from “family spread”—people in sheltering families infecting each other, and also such families cross-infecting other families as they interact in “central locations” such as stores. This second curve, with a lower R0, begins as we begin the transition to shelter-in-place. It has a much lower slope up from the beginning of shelter-in-place, but is as yet unconstrained if R0 still >1.\

> The reason I wrote this note is because I haven’t seen discussed the saddle that we may see.\

> In countries in Asia which killed the first wave we are worried a second separate wave can start. But in the US because of our weak and slow and leaky shelter-in-place we have an additional possibility—that the R0 is still substantially > 1, perhaps as high as seasonal influenza, and thus will have two overlapping curves, resulting in an observed “saddle” as above.\
> \
> The exact shape of these curves depends on the relative R0’s and I also note that there is still some relatively unconstrained spread in the workers for essential services who while they may be doing some physical distancing aren’t e.g. wearing masks or provided with adequate other protections, essentially a fractional version of the first wave. (Aside—it is in this population, e.g. the NYC first responders, who lack adequate protection, that we will probably see the first glimpses of herd immunity, which will, eventually if they aren’t further protected, die away in that subgroup from herd immunity there.)\
> \
> I hope the saddle does not happen, that R0 < 1 with our shelter in place, but that may well not be the case. If R0 is still >1 and we get a saddle it will be discouraging and confusing but should not be surprising.\
> \
> CONCLUSION\
> \
> We should now, but certainly if a saddle emerges, need to do what they did in Wuhan, with a tighter shelter-in-place, wearing of masks, and segregating infectious people and their families. All this is enabled by much more availability of testing or use of other screening measures to stretch testing resources, as will certainly be necessary in other geographies say India).\

\[Note that this is, as above, critical care cases, so translated to day with 10 day hospitalized critical cases it would be 5 and 35 per 100000]

> \
> Current personal masks are very simple and offer only minimal protection. Better masks such as N95’s used by hospital workers are disposable. Our vision is to provide everyone with a better-performing personal mask which they can clean using ordinary household methods—hand washing with soap or hand sanitizer, microwaves, boiling, laundering—thus including methods available to all not just in the West and ones consistent with CDC guidelines (eg when hand washing); the masks would also be cleanable by the more broadly sterilizing methods available in hospitals, including microwaves, steam cleaning, autoclaves and other such sterilization equipment, as in such environments more complete sterilization (beyond COVID) is required.\
> \
> Our goal would be to give each person a well-fitting mask, with masks available in several shapes and sizes, and ones which would last on the order of a year of ordinary use. If such masks even modestly reduce the R0 of COVID they would provide a substantial weapon in containing the current epidemic. They would also be an investment not just an expense, a great tool against any further waves of COVID or variants thereof that might evade a vaccine. Having everyone have such a mask is an affordable investment in pandemic preparedness worldwide.\
> \
> Even a small reduction in R0 can greatly reduce the number of cases. For example, with base R0 at 0.9 (NY Pause ca. mid-April) a reduction to 0.8 would double the rate of reduction of new cases, 0.7 reduces 3.4x faster, 0.6 5x faster. Note that Wuhan was 0.3 which is 11x faster than NY Pause, which is why it led to such a different result than we can currently expect.\
> \
> Ionic Materials has an innovation in polymers which we believe makes such a mask possible. The Ionic polymer is very strong and tolerant of high temperatures and pressures. It can be functionalized to have permanent charge embedded and to incorporate biocidal (nonmetallic) functional groups. Ionic’s part in this effort will be to take a base polymer and to create from that polymer a polymer powder, thread, or film with the aforementioned properties which can intercept with existing operations to make the new reusable masks using non-woven (melt blown) mask making as for current N95’s and also to enable the possibility of using woven or multi-layer extruded manufacturing, which latter processes could be used to make masks or other PPE with the new properties.\
> \
> We also also looking at the possibility of providing the mask polymer in a form which would allow 3D printing of other objects which might thereby  become more sanitary and reusable in a hospital setting.\
> \
> Ionic’s highly functional and durable polymers were created for solid-state batteries, and we started working on this application about a month ago. Our investigations so far lead us to believe that existing mask making lines should be able to manufacture such reusable masks; we hope to prove this in the next few weeks. To go quickly as we hope means we will need to fit into existing manufacturing capability; this seems likely, but is not yet proven.\
> \
> Ionic will need to rapidly scale up the making of the particular polymer. We believe adding the reusability to a typical mask as made today would add perhaps $0.50 of material cost; with margins for outsourced (tolled) manufacturing of the special polymer, and to go quickly this might add to a total goal of about $1 of burdened and margined cost, assuming no supply or processing bottlenecks or inflation from shortages there; given the way the world is for all things related to COVID, we might reasonably expect the costs, in going very quickly, to be somewhat higher.\
> \
> Our high-aspiration goal is to have masks widely available for the fall flu season; we just started this project a month ago so this will require a lot of barrier busting and is by no means certain. We are working to go as fast as we can—whether it is possible to go this fast will depend on our ability to commit to and rapidly procure substantial input materials required for the special polymer, to work with existing polymer compounders to create the new functional polymer, to insert our material quickly into the lines of downstream automated mask making partners, to receive any required approvals, and of course to raise the funds and hire the required staff to proceed with all due haste.\
> \
> We would like to get each of the 330M+- Americans the best reusable personal mask we can get to them quickly, and to further scale up for the rest of the world. We believe this new NPI (non pharmaceutical intervention) would dramatically change the course of this and any future respiratory pandemic.
