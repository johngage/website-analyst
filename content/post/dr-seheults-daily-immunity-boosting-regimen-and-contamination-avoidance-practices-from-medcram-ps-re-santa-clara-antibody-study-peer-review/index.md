This MedCram video, from a sequence of such videos, contains useful information for keeping safe, from a doctor.

> Coronavirus Pandemic Update 59: Dr. Seheult's Daily Regimen (Vitamin D, C, Zinc, Quercetin, NAC)

\
Dr. Seheult describes not only his antiviral regime including C, D and Zinc, Quercetin, NAC, sleep\
but also how he goes to and from his hospital work with COVID patients dealing with clothing and decontamination and the like.\
I hope some of these practical techniques may be of use to you.\
\
I would caveat this, as always, that I am not a doctor, and, as Dr. Seheult says, there is no peer reviewed information supporting his recommendations\
relative to COVID.\
\
I have learned much from watching his now almost 60 almost daily videos on COVID.\

PS There has been a lot of press about the Santa Clara and southern California tests for antibodies.\
The simplest response to these is what Nate Silver posted to Twitter![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=c46a22fdfd&attid=0.1.1&permmsgid=msg-f:1664767240807624800&th=171a70fc360bb060&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ9Ljog66pjXqecD7kRQ_sqzJPQI7qrEmrNOTtYjSw55xNuqWTxnOknutPy-JYuwpM6ocAiwCtoDAiVpk_Rh9FpNhqKlJawJ_adXte5ZBPspvyN4aXPgPjP5djA&disp=emb)\
but I can also recommend that those who are interested a description of a peer review watch what Dr. Seheult posted on

a different Medcram 58 "Update 58: Testing; Causes of Hypoxemia in COVID-19 (V/Q vs Shunt vs Diffusion)"

This Santa Clara relevant material starts at 5:13 into this video talking about the study and at 6:19 the peer review which

discusses the many glaring flaws.

I separately saw a post on Twitter purporting to be a (German?) statistics professor which I remember as saying

that he was going to use this study as his case for teaching, as an example of bad practice in his statistics classes, and that Bayes

was turning over in his grave.

(Wish I could find this thread again if anyone comes across it please forward to me so I can quote it more accurately.)
