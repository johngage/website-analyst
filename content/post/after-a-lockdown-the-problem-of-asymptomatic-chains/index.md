The longer you wait to really lockdown and the shorter the lockdown thereafter the more asymptomatic carriers you have when you come out of lockdown.\
\
Say there are 10000 asymptomatic carriers and the chance of an newly invected person being asymptomatic is 20% when you exit a lockdown.\
If these asymptomatic carriers are released into the population with still little herd immunity\
and without constraint (because they don’t appear sick)\
they can be estimated to cause additional cases at the widely-observed 33% growth rate.\
And of the new cases these asymptomatic carriers cause only 80% will be symptomatic.\
\
So after, for example, a week you would have 10000*1.33^7\~\~75000 new infections, of which 20% or 15000 are asymptomatic.\
Worse 4% of these new cases result from asymptomatic “chains”,\
where an asymptomatic carrier (20% chance to be) had been infected by another asymptomatic carrier (20% chance of that).\
These silent chain transmissions are pernicious and thus very hard to track\
as the “person in the middle” is very difficult to identify and the newest carrier disconnected from anything we know.\
I think of this as like “crowning” in a forest fire—the fire jumps from treetop to treetop past the containment line, often beyond our ability to trace.\
\
Of course we have to continue to do what was done in Wuhan to make the lockdown successful in the first place—\
enforcement, widespread use of masks, widespread temperature testing, isolation of patients who are infected, contact tracing.\
We have, unfortunately, gone past the point where it is possible to ship resources from other parts of the country to the area that is most affected,\
as China dramatically did to Wuhan; the tragic tragic loss of life that will now result from this inability, as the death rate goes due to overload, seems inescapable.\
\
But we don’t have to do a perfect job of isolating patients to get out of the firestorm of the moment, just enough to get R0 << 1.0 for a sufficient time\
to get out of community spread and back to the more difficult detecting and tracing problem described above.\
In Wuhan, because of limited resources, people were checked for infections, and seasonal flu and radiologically\
and if those tests were presumptive negative, they were released presumably to preserve limited COVID testing resources.\
Our constraints will be different, but the procedure used needs to match the resources available and the R0 etc. that is real for us.\
\
Thus even with temperature testing and aggressive contact tracing you will still be fighting a long war, long after the lockdown ends.\
You need lots of contactless medical grade thermometers—WE NEED TO ORDER MILLIONS NOW!\
You need lots of screening and testing and continued isolation—WE NEED TO GET READY TO TRAIN LOTS OF PEOPLE\
(and they need either to be immune or protected!)\
If you don’t do this or let up, this will quickly get out of hand again as we are seeing and will see more elsewhere.\
\
Apply the above to a cruise ship with 10000 people. Do the math yourself.\
You will see how hard it would be to stop the spread inside the ship in any reasonable amount of time.\
You just can’t be sure where the asymptomatic carriers are.\
To stop it you need to spread the people out to break the chains.\
Leaving them all on the ship makes this very very difficult and will thus take an enormous time.\
\
COVID-19 presents us with an enormous challenge. I remember (I believe correctly if naively)\
what was discussed in previous epidemics, how upper respiratory illnesses are more contagious while lower respiratory are more deadly.\
COVID-19 has the truly tragic property of being first one (upper/contagious) and then the other (lower/deadly)\
while also having silent carriers so it behaves more like a disease with a vector than a human-human disease.\
The asymptomatic carriers allow such a disease to evolve to be more deadly as long as the asymptomatic carrier property is preserved,\
which is another risk we face if this evolves. God forbid.\
\
This disease reminds me of a “dreaded adversary”, which knows what you are going to do before you do it,\
and thus thwarts you at every step. Think playing chess with the devil who can read your mind.\
COVID-19 has a large bag of tricks, which can thwart us unless we think several moves ahead--\
it can seem, if we don’t think farther ahead, like it is anticipating and pre-thwarting our moves.\
\
It is long past time to do what was done in Wuhan and more, and to think ahead beyond the lockdown\
to the difficult task that will then remain and prepare.\
