SCENARIO A\
\
One of the best forecasts for what happens next in the US with the Covid-19 pandemic,\
from [https://covid19-​projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/), currently looks like this—\
![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=c46a22fdfd&attid=0.1.1&permmsgid=msg-f:1668238874451258770&th=1726c66ae82a2d92&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ-VUNAPraUBtH1qU8bineW03TIIyWu2a-UECgSrVtNHvnIWJMkHC1MXW-3b10eDpONoV_hkT5fB_c-DNkMZqgbWvFlMolGrBW51uS0CXJQcAv6g7nBRp5YpXzM&disp=emb)\
That is, the deaths per day goes roughly flat, with Rt\~\~1.0, through this September 1.\
\
But the outcome is highly sensitive to Rt—slightly larger Rt will cause the deaths to grow dramatically.\
\
A SUPRISING STATISTIC\
\
Separately, here is one cut, by Pugh, of how death rates have changed in Blue vs. Red congressional districts.\
The result is surprising, in that the Red districts are (intuitively) more rural\
and thus you would think such districts would be less prone to infection and death (lower R0)--\

IThanks to David Shaw for pointing me at this.)\
\
Of course this red-blue data could be confounded by hidden variable (s)

> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/​Confounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding)

I believe the most likely confounding variable is rural vs. urban,\
but, as noted above, this difference would intuitively seem to have the opposite effect,\
for red district deaths to be minimized rather than exaggerated,

thus arguing more strongly for an additional difference or differences.



Herd immunity isn’t likely the difference yet, but incautiousness,

health conditions (e.g. obesity and diabetes) and quality of health care

could be other confounders (explanations).

We know rural districts, especially in the South, have health and healthcare problems.\
In any case, whatever confounders there may be,

this shows deaths can vary substantially in different sub-populations.\
\
Scenario B arises because of a possible difference in behavior in subpopulations.\
The “black elephant" in the room is the non-linearity—\
a linear change in behavior, i.e in frequency of interaction,\
even if only in a modest subpopulation, makes an exponential difference in outcome.\
\
ASIDE

I learned the term “black elephant” just yesterday from this excellent article in today's NY Times\
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/​05/30/opinion/sunday/​coronavirus-globalization.​html?smid=em-share](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-globalization.html?smid=em-share)\
entitled “How We Broke the World—Greed and globalization set us up for disaster” by Tom Friedman\
where, after discussing 9/11, the 2008 recession, COVID-19 and climate catastrophe, he writes:

> As I look back over the last 20 years, what all four of these global calamities have in common
>
> is that they are all “black elephants,” a term coined by the environmentalist Adam Sweidan.
>
> A black elephant is a cross between “a black swan” — an unlikely, unexpected event with enormous ramifications--

Linear behavioral changes yielding exponential infections can have enormous ramifications.

We run a risk of this effect at a time when we likely do not have sufficient testing and contact tracing in place

(the virus will “find” such places),

and at a time where there are still a lot of cases because of a relatively weak “lockdown”.

END ASIDE



SCENARIO B (AND THREE SUB-SCENARIOS)\
\
Suppose 15% of Americans (eperhaps not insubstantially the "liberty / no face mask" cohort)\
starts interacting relatively more openly (i.e. incautiously).\
The polarization of America means this subgroup is likely to interact very heavily among itself.\
The risk is much greater in any bilateral unprotected (< 6 feet, indoor, mutually no masks) interactions.

Further suppose, and I don’t think this is such an unreasonable assumption,

that the Rt in such a subgroup increases so that it results in a doubling every half-month (2 weeks+).\
\
Then, after two months, the 15% subgroup which was contributing 15% of the cases before,\
would instead, through increased infection within the subgroup,\
contribute 2^4x=16x of the infections it did before, causing the overall total\
to be 15%\*2^4\*85% = 325% of what the total was before.\
\
So how long would this take to show up?\
Well, assume it typically takes a couple weeks to hospitalization

and then a couple weeks to death, i.e. a total of 30 days.\
Then the statistics in the 15% group and total population vs baseline might be—

![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=c46a22fdfd&attid=0.1.3&permmsgid=msg-f:1668238874451258770&th=1726c66ae82a2d92&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ97Kgs_2HiPWdC_zbhYfEblqhMdEpbFTovmdemjV-_49MqJbAy7x8jIJ3UxSpk613ltnWCj9IpdHwmVv5wHKsjaXHsgO5RovRLpBxEbtt5LZmPsRh706iECjk8&disp=emb)\
So under this simple model we would see deaths increasing by about June 15\
and then accelerating in the last half of June and into July.\
Hospitalizations would increase starting a couple weeks earlier than deaths.\
\
Also if, as seems likely, there was not-insubstantial incautious behavior over Memorial Day weekend\
that should show up in deaths in about a month, e.g. circa July 1,\
and in added hospitalizations starting about June 15.\
\
My friend Amory Lovins, founder of Rocky Mountain Institute, likes to say\
“systems without feedback are stupid” and so we can imagine that some of the 15%

who are behaving “loosely” might notice, say by July 1, that the death rate was materially increasing.\
Suppose then that 1/2 of them go back to more careful behavior leaving\
7.5% still behaving in the way where Rt is doubling in a half-month.\
What we would then might have, instead, is the following sub-scenario—![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=c46a22fdfd&attid=0.1.4&permmsgid=msg-f:1668238874451258770&th=1726c66ae82a2d92&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ99rMVNNwLw7_3K6fDnRSWfQHv9jtE17s-ZpoF01MT3-97ypesgIccMKf-W_kgPCcm5YAUAjue0_glBrYw12FTy83y_pwQ6LLj7R_sOWdNv0zd31l5S1kkDbOk&disp=emb)

This is better than the above, but would still feel pretty bad.\
\
Of course we could also have all of the 15% resume previous behavior around July 1,\
which would achieve steady state with the value a month after July 1 e.g. the August 1 325% of previous.

That is if the Scenario A prior is 1000 deaths per day approximately this might level at about 3250.\
This is likely very unacceptable, so as a third sub-scenario I project what might happen, instead,\
if we went back into a lockdown as before, and the deaths trended as they have done from May 1 to June 1\
on the covid-19 projections website e.g. at about 25% down each two weeks—\
![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=c46a22fdfd&attid=0.1.5&permmsgid=msg-f:1668238874451258770&th=1726c66ae82a2d92&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ8EuprMNnwYwYwwy8LyHq5K0ahCLdwX-MyeQoe3lf8sGB-E_U9Mx3c7PS-q0YYHkFEDErJZI6iUVPyTPbH_SplCurQEuQoRmk84SAb_XeSXA1umbCvew5Jm0C0&disp=emb)\
In this final sub-scenario it takes 3 full months of pre-opening behaivor

to get back to the status quo ante of May 1,\
substantially longer than the 2 months of fractional incautiousness.

(As has been widely noted elsewhere, In a rolling-wave open/close scenario 

you tend to spend more time closed than open, to achieve a return to status quo ante.)



Here is what the three sub-scenarios look graphed on linear scale—

and on log scale—\
![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=c46a22fdfd&attid=0.1.7&permmsgid=msg-f:1668238874451258770&th=1726c66ae82a2d92&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ-pstgOVoukY_-6eSR6kJo0sD5dUz4q_-6BjaxReT5KEATcbKmZMOsApStTdGyPPl9Rnqw3bsqmUCfWaKiydFbNLy6QE5QzaJanlXHacfxyTX2e_VxelfbVeyk&disp=emb)\
\
\
CONCLUSION\
\
If something like this scenario B happens it shouldn’t be a surprise.\
A return to exponential growth from a linear change in behavior by a sub-population\
is easily foreseen as a possibility with large impact,

and therefore qualifies as a "Black Elephant”.\
\
I hope Scenario B doesn’t happen in any form.\
