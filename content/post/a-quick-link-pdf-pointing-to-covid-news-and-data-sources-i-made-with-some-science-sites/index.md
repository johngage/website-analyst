I also made a short version on Medium

I love the aerosol information.  This is huge for the Kenyan slum project……we had lines last week of several thousand people with no physical distancing.



I’m sending all your aerosol info to the Kenyan Minister of Health, and to our operation in Kibera, Nairobi.



Thanks…..
