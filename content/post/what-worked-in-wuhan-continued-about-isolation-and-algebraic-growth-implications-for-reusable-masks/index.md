The paper “Effective containment explains subexponential growth in recent confirmed COVID-19 cases in China”\
> [https://science.sciencemag.org​/content/sci/early/2020/04/07/​science.abb4557.full.pdf](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2020/04/07/science.abb4557.full.pdf)\
which was released April 8 but just seen by me (thanks to David Shaw)\
reinforces points I have made before and provides additional insight.\
\
It shows the continued peril in not doing what works in Wuhan.\
\
**PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS ABOUT SUBEXPONENTIAL (ALGEBRAIC/POLYNOMIAL) GROWTH IN EARLY STAGES**\
\
I have previously pointed out that:

\
> In the early stages of an epidemic it can proceed algebraically rather than exponentially essentially in the seeding “pre-epidemic” phase, as described in this paper

\
> [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.012​16.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01216.pdf)

\
> which abstract begins\
>> Early estimates of the transmission potential of emerging and re-emerging infections are increasingly used to inform public health authorities on the level of risk posed by outbreaks.

\
>> Existing methods to estimate the reproduction number generally assume exponential growth in case incidence in the first few disease generations, before susceptible depletion sets in.

\
>> In reality, outbreaks can display sub-exponential (i.e., polynomial) growth in the first few disease generations, owing to clustering in contact patterns, spatial effects, inhomogeneous mixing, reactive behavior changes, or other mechanisms.

\
> the difference in growth rate with polynomial rather than exponential growth is of course stunning.\
\
**SUBEXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN CHINA/WUHAN**\
\
What we learn from this new paper is that what was done in Wuhan did not simply reduce the exponent in exponential growth but rather than the segregation of cases e.g. away from their uninfected families, specifically, from the abstract:

\
>> The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China was characterized by a distinctive  subexponential \[!!!!!] increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic,  contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak.

\
>> We show that this effect can be explained as a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population.

\
>> To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both\
> quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately.

\
>> The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19  or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.

\
That is, there is another situation where algebraic/polynomial growth was observed, no small point.\
\
The detailed modeling here is very interesting but beyond the scope of this note (see a few extracts in PS below).\
\
The important point is that by \*\*not\*\* copying what was done in Wuhan, segregating e.g. positives and their potentially positive contacts, we in the West have kept exponential behavior at times when what China achieved was algebraic in “seemingly” similar conditions.\
\
**WE CONTINUE TO FAIL TO DO WHAT WAS DONE IN WUHAN AT OUR PERIL**\
\
We continue to not do what was done in Wuhan at our peril. We now recognize that confining sick people with their families causes “family spread” but now must not fail to understand this can be the difference between polynomial/algebraic growth and exponential!\
\
**IMPLICATIONS FOR REUSABLE MASKS—THE MASKS FOR MANHATTAN PROJECT**\
\
The strategy of taking you away from your family if you are infected and isolating\
and taking care of you so you can’t infect others is widely viewed to be difficult in the West.

It is likely to be impossible in other geographies such as in Africa due to cultural difficulties and lack of resources.

\
So if we are to get R0 << 1 or even < 1 in these other geographies without a vaccine or herd immunity and for future epidemics and pandemics we need a strategy which is practical in such contexts.

\
Reusable personally cleanable masks provide such a solution, and a practical way forward.\
\
Our group at **Ionic Materials** continues to move forward, as aggressively as we can, to come up with a plan that would allow widespread worldwide available of reusable personal masks, developing and scaling as quickly as is possible. Doing this will require substantial investment, cooperation and adoption of the plan to have such masks widely available.

This is truly a “Plan B” to backstop Vaccines and Therapies which may prove to be more difficult than we assume.

\
We can’t, in my opinion, afford not to do this.\
\
I will close with an incomplete list of the reasons widespread use of such masks is more than resilient, ie  “anti-fragile”---that is, it thrives if there is chaos in the epidemic, continuing to work when other strategies are defeated--\
> This doesn't require 100% compliance.\
> This doesn't require perfection usage.\
> This doesn't depend on therapies.\
> This handles asymptomatics.\
> This doesn't require massive contact tracing.\
> This doesn't require vaccines to work.\
> This doesn't require more doctors and nurses.\
> This doesn't require ventilators.\
> This doesn’t require widespread testing\
> This doesn't require drugs which are in short supply.\
> This handles evolution of the virus to evade our vaccines and therapies.\
> This works in future outbreaks.\
> This is an investment not an expense.\
> … I’m sure there are more\

**PS A FEW MORE INTERESTING POINTS FROM THE PAPER**

\
>> An initial exponential growth of confirmed cases is generically expected for an uncontrolled outbreak, as observed e.g., during the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic (10) or the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa (11).

\
>> This initial outbreak is in most cases mitigated with a time delay by effective containment strategies and policies that reduce transmission and effective reproduction of the virus, commonly yielding a saturation in the cumulative case count and an exponential decay in the number of new infections (12).

\
> >Although in Hubei the number of laboratory-confirmed cases C(t) was observed to grow exponentially in early January, the subsequent rise followed a subexponential, super-linear, algebraic scaling law tμ with an exponent μ = 2.3 (between Jan. 24th and Feb. 9th), cf. Fig. 1A.  For the majority of the affected Chinese provinces of Mainland China, however, this type of algebraic rise occurred from the beginning of case re- porting on Jan. 21st.

\
>> The exponents μ fluctuate around a typical value of μ = 2.1 0.3± for the confirmed case curves in other substantially affected provinces (confirmed case counts larger than 500 on Feb. 12th), displaying algebraic growth despite geographical, socio-economical differences, possible differences in containment strategies,  and heterogeneities that may have variable impacts on how the local epidemic unfolds, cf. Fig. 1B-C.

\
>> Eventually, case counts began to deviate from the observed scaling laws around Feb. 9th for Hubei and in early February for the remaining provinces, approaching a saturation behavior 

\> Initially, a small fraction of infecteds yields an exponential growth if the basic reproduction number is larger than unity.\
> A simple reduction of contacts caused by quarantine policies without additional shielding of susceptibles could be associated with a reduction in the effective reproduction number, which would, however, still yield an exponential growth in I (t ) if R0 > 1inconsistent with the observed transient scaling law tμ discussed above.
