The attached Science magazine paper, posted today studies what we might expect after a first wave subsides, assuming we have only non-pharmaceutical interventions (distancing, masks, etc.). It is sobering,\
\
This new paper assumes a R0 between 2 and 2.5, which matches closely to what is generally assumed.\
Here quoting now this earlier LANL paper I had circulated [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/arti​cle/26/7/20-0282_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article)\
such an estimate range is derived from the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggesting a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2–2.7.

\
We can only hope that the LANL author’s estimate of a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9) is incorrect as the results will be \*\*very much\*\* more dire than the new paper attach here suggest without substantial additional NPIs.\
\
This new paper shows how important the length of immunity will be.\
Short-term immunity (on the order of 40 weeks, similar to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-KHU1\
favors the establishment of annual SARS_CoV-2 outbreaks, while lnoger-term immunity (two years) favors biennial outbreaks.\
They also study low- and high- seasonal variation\
A 40% summertime decline in R0 would reduce the unmitigated peak incidence of the initial SAR-CoV-2 pandemic wave.\
However, stronger seasonal forcing leads to a greater accumulation of susceptible individuals during period of low transmission in the summer, leading to recurrent outbreaks with higher peaks in the post-pandemic period.

> I note they make what seem like optimistic assumptions that only 3.08% of infections require hospitalizations and only 1.32% require critical care, and that peak R0 is between 2 and 2.6, and that social distancing reduces R0 by up to 60%.\

> which is why it will take a long time to get down to 5 per 10000 in NYC (if in fact we do, that is if R0 with the current arrangement is low enough to get there see more below).\

> There are a lot of observations from the simulations here. So for example long periods of social distance don’t necessarily reduce future peaks\
> In the case of a 20-week period of social distancing with 60% reduction in R0, for example (Fig 4D) the resurgence peak size was nearly the same as the peak size of the uncontrolled epidemic:\

> There is a lot more here—scenarios showing shutdowns of various lengths and the resultant waves which depend on immunity, R0, seasonality, herd immunity, cross-immunity and many other factors, most of which we don’t have final firm handles on.\

> This is all very sobering. My personal models are much simpler than what is shown here, but have given me pause like here and more, because I have been assuming that it quite likely the case that R0 is still > 1 even with shelter-in-place, this even before allowing for a much higher R0. There is a very troubling comment here, almost an aside, that says, in the first column of page 2

> Still, countries that have achieved this level of control of the outbreak should prepare for the possibility of substantial resurgences of infection and a return to social distancing measures \[paradoxically!] especially if a seasonal forcing contributes to a rise in transmissibility in the winter. Moreover, a winter peak for COVID-19 would coincide with peak influenza incidence, further straining health care systems.\

> My takeaways:\

1. We hope for therapies in the short run and a vaccine sooner that can be usually expected.\
   We can spend money and go as fast as possible to try to make these things happen,\
   but need to do the best to prepare for NPI’s as our tool for a while.\
2. Even if R0 is 2.0-2.7 this will be very difficult to control; whatever the R0 is\
   the fact that Washington is struggling to keep R0 < 1 (if it is) is troubling and makes\
   “opening up” very difficult without additive NPI’s that work even with opening up.\
3. We would benefit immensely from an innovative in personal masks, as I have been advocating, e.g.\
   personal well-fitting N95 or better masks that can be cleaned (microwaved, boiled or hopefully washed)\
   as a tool to materially decrease R0 both in the shelter-in-place regime\
   (which still has substantial essential- and healthcare- workers circulating)\
   and especially if we want to be more open.\
   Without this, as the authors conclude near the end\
