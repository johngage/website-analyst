All—\
\
I have been working on the problem of existential threats for 20 years.\
I hereby forward some links to some of this writing speaking and action\
which is relevant to our current predicament.\
\
I do not send this out of ego or pride—having recognized these dangers\
over the last 20 years and focusing on them I failed in my efforts to avert them.\
I, instead, hope the thoughts here can contribute in some small way\
to a wiser and wider discussion of the best path forward.\
\
Best,\

WIRED ARTICLE APRIL 2000 “WHY THE FUTURE DOESN’T NEED US”\
\
My public advocacy started with a Wired Magazine article “Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us”\
which talked about the danger of exponential runaways through self-replication\
and the asymmetric dangers they pose.\
This long form article was the cover story in the April 2000 issue of Wired magazine.

> Here are some thoughts from that paper, which read on the difficult choices ahead as we see a new, sustainable, normal:\
> \
> *"It might be a familiar progression, transpiring on many worlds—a planet, newly formed, placidly revolves around its star; life slowly forms; a kaleidoscopic procession of creatures evolves; intelligence emerges which, at least up to a point, confers enormous survival value; and then technology is invented. It dawns on them that there are such things as laws of Nature, that these laws can be revealed by experiment, and that knowledge of these laws can be made both to save and to take lives, both on unprecedented scales. Science, they recognize, grants immense powers. In a flash, they create world-altering contrivances. Some planetary civilizations see their way through, place limits on what may and what must not be done, and safely pass through the time of perils. Others, not so lucky or so prudent, perish."*\
> \
> *That is Carl Sagan, writing in 1994, in Pale Blue Dot, a book describing his vision of the human future in space. I am only now realizing how deep his insight was, and how sorely I miss, and will miss, his voice. For all its eloquence, Sagan's contribution was not least that of simple common sense—an attribute that, along with humility, many of the leading advocates of the 21st-century technologies seem to lack.*\
> \
> *I remember from my childhood that my grandmother was strongly against the overuse of antibiotics. She had worked since before the first World War as a nurse and had a commonsense attitude that taking antibiotics, unless they were absolutely necessary, was bad for you.*\
> \
> *It is not that she was an enemy of progress. She saw much progress in an almost 70-year nursing career; my grandfather, a diabetic, benefited greatly from the improved treatments that became available in his lifetime. But she, like many levelheaded people, would probably think it greatly arrogant for us, now, to be designing a robotic "replacement species," when we obviously have so much trouble making relatively simple things work, and so much trouble managing—or even understanding—ourselves.*\
> \
> *I realize now that she had an awareness of the nature of the order of life, and of the necessity of living with and respecting that order. With this respect comes a necessary humility that we, with our early-21st-century chutzpah, lack at our peril. The commonsense view, grounded in this respect, is often right, in advance of the scientific evidence. The clear fragility and inefficiencies of the human-made systems we have built should give us all pause; the fragility of the systems I have worked on certainly humbles me.*\
> \
> *We should have learned a lesson from the making of the first atomic bomb and the resulting arms race. We didn't do well then, and the parallels to our current situation are troubling.*\
> \
> *Nearly 20 years ago, in the documentary The Day After Trinity, \[the, sadly, late] Freeman Dyson summarized the scientific attitudes that brought us to the nuclear precipice:*\
> \
> *"I have felt it myself. The glitter of nuclear weapons. It is irresistible if you come to them as a scientist. To feel it's there in your hands, to release this energy that fuels the stars, to let it do your bidding. To perform these miracles, to lift a million tons of rock into the sky. It is something that gives people an illusion of illimitable power, and it is, in some ways, responsible for all our troubles—this, what you might call technical arrogance, that overcomes people when they see what they can do with their minds."*\
> \
> *I believe that we all wish our course could be determined by our collective values, ethics, and morals. If we had gained more collective wisdom over the past few thousand years, then a dialogue to this end would be more practical, and the incredible powers we are about to unleash would not be nearly so troubling.*\
> \
> *One would think we might be driven to such a dialogue by our instinct for self-preservation. Individuals clearly have this desire, yet as a species our behavior seems to be not in our favor. In dealing with the nuclear threat, we often spoke dishonestly to ourselves and to each other, thereby greatly increasing the risks. Whether this was politically motivated, or because we chose not to think ahead, or because when faced with such grave threats we acted irrationally out of fear, I do not know, but it does not bode well.*\
> \
> \
> *I recently had the good fortune to meet the distinguished author and scholar Jacques Attali, whose book Lignes d'horizons ( Millennium, in the English translation) helped inspire the Java and Jini approach to the coming age of pervasive computing, as previously described in this magazine. In his new book Fraternités, Attali describes how our dreams of utopia have changed over time:*\
> \
> *"At the dawn of societies, men saw their passage on Earth as nothing more than a labyrinth of pain, at the end of which stood a door leading, via their death, to the company of gods and to Eternity. With the Hebrews and then the Greeks, some men dared free themselves from theological demands and dream of an ideal City where Liberty would flourish. Others, noting the evolution of the market society, understood that the liberty of some would entail the alienation of others, and they sought Equality."*\
> \
> *Jacques helped me understand how these three different utopian goals exist in tension in our society today. He goes on to describe a fourth utopia, Fraternity, whose foundation is altruism. Fraternity alone associates individual happiness with the happiness of others, affording the promise of self-sustainment.*\
> \
> *This crystallized for me my problem with Kurzweil's dream. A technological approach to Eternity—near immortality through robotics—may not be the most desirable utopia, and its pursuit brings clear dangers. Maybe we should rethink our utopian choices.*\
> \
> *Where can we look for a new ethical basis to set our course? I have found the ideas in the book Ethics for the New Millennium, by the Dalai Lama, to be very helpful. As is perhaps well known but little heeded, the Dalai Lama argues that the most important thing is for us to conduct our lives with love and compassion for others, and that our societies need to develop a stronger notion of universal responsibility and of our interdependency; he proposes a standard of positive ethical conduct for individuals and societies that seems consonant with Attali's Fraternity utopia.*\
> \
> *The Dalai Lama further argues that we must understand what it is that makes people happy, and acknowledge the strong evidence that neither material progress nor the pursuit of the power of knowledge is the key—that there are limits to what science and the scientific pursuit alone can do.*\
> \
> *Our Western notion of happiness seems to come from the Greeks, who defined it as "the exercise of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording them scope."15*\
> \
> *Clearly, we need to find meaningful challenges and sufficient scope in our lives if we are to be happy in whatever is to come. But I believe we must find alternative outlets for our creative forces, beyond the culture of perpetual economic growth; this growth has largely been a blessing for several hundred years, but it has not brought us unalloyed happiness, and we must now choose between the pursuit of unrestricted and undirected growth through science and technology and the clear accompanying dangers.*



> **COMMONWEALTH CLUB OF CALIFORNIA SPEECH “MORALITY IN THE DOT COM ERA” JUNE 2000**\
> \
> Shortly after writing the Wired article, in June of 2000 I gave a speech at the Commonwealth Club of California,\
> where I described how our lack of understanding of pandemics put us at risk.\

and mostly about the same asymmetric dangers of runaway exponential consequences from new technologies, but here is a key passage. I felt it important to speak these two horrible troubling paragraphs, which we are now, unfortunately, experiencing—

{{% staticref "media/Image 4-15-20 at 11.40 AM.jpeg" "newtab" %}}Commonwealth two paragraphs{{% /staticref %}}\
\
We are sadly now experiencing some of the things the ancients did, feeling the loss of control to pestilences, and the terrible sadness of losing our ability to be with our loved ones when they die, and seeing bodies pile up.\
\
I am so sad that this is happening. That this could be foreseen is unfortunately very true.\
We didn’t prepare and forestall this clear danger.\
\
**DAVOS PANEL 2002**\
\
Hereby a description of a panel discussion on the issues my Wired article raised.\
This panel, in 2002, was an attempt to have the kind of discussion involving many points of view\
that I think we now need to have about the path forward with the dangers we face.\
\
*This* from an unpublished book-length adaption of the *Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us* article.\
(I abandoned this book when I decided, instead, to focus on solutions with venture capital,\
which led to the below-mentioned KPCB Pandemic Fund and Greentech Practice).

> *After the Wired article appeared I did a lot of press and television.*\
> \
> *Eventually I tired of this, of saying my positions over and over again, and sought, instead to create dialogue.*
>
> \
> *I was asked, for example, by the organizers of the World Economic Forum in Davos to organize a plenary panel on the dangers I had written about.*\
> \
> *By that time I had developed a clear idea of the kind of conversation I wanted to have.*\
> *I had always been taken by the imaginary conversations that Steve Allen had had on the Tonight show so long ago. I never saw many of these, I am far too young to have seen them live, but I’m sure you know the conceit—great people in history who never met yet get together for conversations. This is the stuff of much literature and theater.*\
> \
> *But rather than imaginary dead people what I imagined was that we would get together*\
> *a group of different kinds of people to talk about these issues. My ideal “discussion salon” would consist of a philosopher, an ethicist or spiritual person, a poet, a religious person and a scientist.*
>
> \
> *Oh, and an ordinary person, with some common sense.*\
> \
> *Well, we put together such a panel at Davos and I have to say I think it was very interesting.*
>
> \
> *We had a number of interesting panelists (I am getting the exact list of names together),*\
> *but perhaps the most interesting was Mario Vargas Llosa, representing the “poet” (he is actually a novelist). I am getting the transcript of what he said, but the point is that it’s incredibly important to sit the technical and scientific people down in a panel format like this and make them interact with these other elements of society*
>
> *I remember, in particular, the biologist on the panel and the late computer scientist Michael Dertouszos, both so strongly arguing the myths \[as are driving, in the current COVID-era desire to return to the “old normal”] I have so carefully deconstructed above.*\
> *They were literal caricatures of the myths of our time, and in complete denial that any other approach was possible.*\
> \
> *What was sadly missing from this panel was an “ordinary person”.*
>
> \
> *Having “teed up” the discussion I now realize what I should have then done is to turn my chair over to someone chosen, effectively at random, from the audience, to represent all of us who are kidnapped to the agenda that the scientists and engineers on the panel are enabling, \[and in the current COVID situation the economic stakeholders in our current unsustainable path] and that are myths are driving us to, to speak with common sense. Regretfully, I did not do this.*\
> \
> *I did another version of this panel at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.,*\
> *with Ray Kurzweil, representing science, Bill McKibben, who first described for a large audience the dangers of global climate change in his book The End of Nature, representing the poet/writer, and Anna Foerst, representing the spiritual community, though she actually works at MIT with robots, so she wasn’t that different from Ray Kurzweil in her outlook.*
>
> \
> *Once again I failed to have an ordinary person or the breadth of conversation that I really wanted to have.*\
> \
> *I think this idea is still a good one.* 
>
> *But I hope you can see, in microcosm, from my attempts to bring together a good discussion, the difficulty we will have in the large. The scientific and technical people \[and now monied interests] dominate the dialogue. What we need to hear is the voices from our spiritual community, people who can speak to ethics, from the heart, and the commonsense voices of ordinary people affected by all this, who can bring their personal experience and values to the discussion.*\
> \
> **KPCB PANDEMIC FUND FORMATION 2006**\
> \
> By 2006 I was working in Venture Capital at KPCB and spending full time on addressing the two existential crises through innovation, helping to start the Sustainability / Green Tech practice at KPCB and advocating for the formation of the KPCB Pandemic fund.
>
> \
> The KPCB Pandemic fund attempted to use venture capital innovation to prepare for pandemics, including starting a company which was working to provide surge ventilator capacity.\

> \
> These efforts leveraged the advocacy of George W. Bush and others like Bill Frist\
> who raised the need for pandemic preparedness and led to formation of agencies like BARDA.
>
> \
> Unfortunately, now a decade and a half later, these efforts stalled out. The companies we started didn’t get the orders they needed to survive and thrive. The remaining efforts were underfunded, delayed and inadquate in scope. As is now well documented, the US government recently and tragically abandoned many of these efforts, weakening the surveillance and demoting the people who would have been in a position to most strongly advocate, and then ignoring clear warnings.
>
> \
> Faced with an exponentially growing threat where even a few days magnifies\
> the danger greatly, such delays and unpreparedness has led us to a very difficult situation.\
> \
> **MY TED TALK 2006 “*WHAT I’M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT I’M EXCITED ABOUT*"**\
> \
> I gave a TED talk in Monterrey in 2006, talking about the above and the need for and the\
> promise of the work on pandemics and clean technology.\
> This occurred just after we had raised the KPCB Pandemic Fund.\
> \
>  [https://www.ted.com/talks/bill​_joy_what_i_m_worried\_about\_​what_i_m_excited_about?languag​e=en](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_joy_what_i_m_worried_about_what_i_m_excited_about?language=en)\
> \
> \
> I had forgotten about this talk, and it didn’t get much traction at the time— our collective focus was elsewhere. I find it very sad to watch this talk now and to imagine what could have been.\
> \
> I described in the talk how a pandemic could be 1000x worse than the seasonal flu in its impact. We have seen that occur financially; I just pray it yet doesn’t occur so medically, as it did in 1918.\
> \
> **GOING FORWARD — 2020**\
> \
> So here we are in 2020, in the midst of a pandemic.\
> \
> I talked in my 2006 TED talk about the promise of new materials, specifically there carbon nanotubes.
>
> \
> We pursued such new materials in our work on clean technology.
>
> \
> In particular we found two amazing classes of new materials—\
> *a new type of ceramics* which can replace ordinary cement, potentially turning cement and concrete from a major emitter into a consumer of CO2, and a *new type of polymer* which can make solid state batteries and now, hopefully, reusable masks to quash this pandemic, and future epidemics and pandemics, mechanically.\
> \
> Such major breakthroughs toward sustainability in materials can have application far beyond those initially envisioned for them.\
> \
> The “hydrothermal liquid phase sintering” that yields the dramatic reduction in emissions from concrete and cement can also allow us to make **cermets**\
> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/​Cermet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cermet) with polymer, and to replace many of the extractive building materials we make to have incredible materials properties and low embodied energy, low environmental impact and incredibly low cost, replacing wood, gypsum, steel, aluminum and many other widely used materials.\
> \
> If we dream of a truly sustainable future we should be investing heavily in such transitional technologies.
>
> \
> But displacing incumbents in these industries is difficult, developing and scaling such technologies can take a decade—the startups here-- **Solidia** and **RRTC** --are about a decade all into the effort.
>
> \
> Keeping such ventures alive has been a struggle—we need them but money is made more easily elsewhere and we have been distracted by entertainments.\
> \
> The crystalline polymers of **Ionic Materials** now let us hope not only of radically low cost and safe batteries to fully electrify wheeled transportation, regional aviation and enable a fully-renewable grid, but of a long-term reusable, personally cleanable =N95 mask. 
>
> I have written much of this, and attach a description, again, below, but I would just also point out that this is an effort, starting with a scientist who had much experience, which also has stretched over a decade.\
> \
> **FINAL THOUGHTS**\
> \
> In August of 2000 I was honored to be invited to speak on the opening plenary panel for the 50th Annviersary of the Aspen Institute. The last part of what I said then applies I believe strongly to the situation we find ourselves in now. Here is what I said then—\
> \
> \
> *The tools we have built and our unbounded spread and transgression of planetary boundaries, in this case species habitat destruction, are imperiling us. We can choose otherwise.*\
> \
> In the book manuscript from 2002 I also wrote:

> *We can’t have faith that markets will produce better economic outcomes if we hide from the markets the dangers and costs of catastrophes.*\
> *We can’t expect the “invisible hand” of the marketplace to guide us to sensible outcomes if we do not provide economic signals based on our values, on what we wish to encourage and preserve.*\
> *Otherwise, without direction and blind to the true costs of catastrophe the markets will seek short-term gain at high speed, careening toward the disasters that clearly lie ahead.*\
> *Thus markets solve what they solve, but not everything. They are very good at “go” but terrible at “stop.”*\
> *When “stop” to avoid existential danger is what they need, they are maladapted.*\
