Dear Scientists of the Future—

As a fan of the movie and TV series 12 Monkeys, and realizing how hard-to-impossible time travel likely is I yet write this letter in the faint hope that it might be possible, at some point in the future, to send, at least some amount of information back to our time, I am writing to ask for a specific favor.

We are beset, here in April 2020, by the Sars-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. It seems to have had a very large amount of time to coevolve with the bat immune system and now has crossed to humans, armed with a Swiss Army Knife of tools it used over time to attack the bats.

As the bats evolved and close off some of these attacks, the virus seems to have developed more. Faced as we are with defending its multiple de novo attacks on us, we are struggling. We don’t have defenses in our bodies for these attacks and are struggling to find therapies and vaccines. We are concerned to have just learned that this virus seems to attack and kill T cells.

We are struggling with the asymptomatic carriers, and frightened that their presence does not prevent evolution of the virus to a form with a higher case fatality rate if such a successful variant version retains the asymptomatic carriers.

Could you please share some technology with us?

The simplest would probably be if you can share how to do a universal vaccine for the betacoronavirus family to block evolutionary paths for this virus. Hopefully it is within the ambit of our technology to be able to manufacture that. If not, and we have the ability to reasonably make the necessary machines with early 21st century technology perhaps you could send blueprints for those also?

If such a vaccine is not possible, and a bigger stick is needed, perhaps you could send us information on how to transfer that portion of the bat immune (and if necessary other bat) systems to humans so that we can upgrade our immune system to be able to disarm this virus. This seems quite beyond our current understanding so that may require a very large amount of information.

I have a [mac.com](http://mac.com/) account with several Terabytes of space free. If you could put a file in that account with the instructions of what we should do we will be very grateful. If you cannot send this when you get this message, please save this request so that if it is possible in the future then such a message can be sent.

We recognize this is a big ask. That changes we make may affect your future, as it did in 12 Monkeys. Or perhaps you know whether the parallel universes theory is correct and that is not a risk.

In any case, thanks in advance for reading this.

We know waiting for a response is a long shot, but we need all the help we can get.

I am circulating this message widely to have a greater chance of a copy of this message surviving and coming to your attention.

Sincerely,

Bill Joy

PS If you need to send the files to the wnjoy@[mac.com](http://mac.com/) account encrypted then hopefully somewhere there are files of mine in an archive that are encrypted which encryption should be breakable by your quantum computers—

please use the password you thereby determine.
