The precautionary principle [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/​Precautionary_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle) is\
> "a strategy for approaching issues of potential harm when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. It emphasizes caution, pausing and review before leaping into new innovations that may prove disastrous”\
\
This principle is widely insufficiently applied and almost an anathema to thinking in the United States. If we truly believed in the precautionary principle we would have taken strong climate action long ago.\
\
But it strongly informs the discussion of masks which is to say that if the lack of wearing masks can substantially possibly cause a great harm then we should wear them, even if their utility is unproven.\
\
Scientists and journalists who write articles saying it is unclear whether masks work thereby suggesting maybe we shouldn’t do this are operating in a framework and mindset ignoring the precautionary principle. To do so is irresponsible.\
\
The only countries who seem to have won, even if temporarily, against the virus have used masks widely. Arguing from uncertainty that we should not is fatally flawed, throwing proper and common-sense caution to the wind.\

PS I should have said also that when you are dealing with exponential runaways, the precautionary principle is RADICALLY MORE IMPORTANT. If say masks reduce R0 by 0.2 then it could be the difference between R0=1.1 and a runaway and R0=0.9 and a gradual decline. In health- as in climate-change- potential runaways, the precautionary principle is exponentially more important to decision making.
