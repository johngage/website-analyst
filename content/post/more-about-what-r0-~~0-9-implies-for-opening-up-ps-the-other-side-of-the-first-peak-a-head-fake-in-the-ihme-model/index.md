SOME R0 DATA FROM NY—NY PAUSE IS \~\~ 0.9



As I previously noted,

NY Governor Cuomo today, in his briefing, noted that “NY Pause” had reduced the R0 to about 0.9.

He noted that Wuhan was believed to be at 0.3 during their much more effective shutdown.

Simple math that 0.9^11=0.3 shows that cutting the cases close to 0 takes about 10x as long at 0.9 ugh.

Wuhan took a couple months of that intense stay-at-home, separate quarantine, contact tracing etc. before they lifted the cordon sanitaire. It’s hard to believe NY will hold together for 10x as long as Wuhan.

Stricter lockdown or better NPI’s would be needed to reduce R0 further. Perhaps simple masks will reduce the 10x.

**THEY BELIEVE UPPER TOLERABLE IS 1.2**

But Cuomo also said that he felt the highest R0 could go would be 1.2 that is if R0 1.2 was some sort of upper limit,

conceivably for how open he could be to avoid the spread getting too out-of-control while opening.

But such a low margin between 0.9 and 1.2 i.e. a R0 0.3 margin doesn’t leave much room for opening.

**HOW MUCH MARGIN DOES THIS GIVE YOU, MEASURED IN “% OPEN”?**

This can be seen by a very simple model. Imagine that 10% of the people are currently essential and moving around, and some of the other stay-at-home 90% wish to join them. The blend of the essential’s current R0 and the stay-at-home’s R0 is, in composite, 0.9. So imagine that the essentials R0 are the unconstrained R0=2.7 often bandied about.

The 10%\*2.7+90%\*SAH=0.9, i.e. the stay-at-home R0 is 0.7. If we promote a SAH to moving around like the essentials then the R0 delta is 1.8. So if we have 0.3 R0 to play with, we can allow at most 0.3/1.8 = 1/6 of the SAH people to move around or, more generally, about 1/6 of the normal activity.

We could, of course, assume that the R0 of the essentials is actually lower, but that means the R0 of the SAH’s is higher and it then cuts both ways—they contribute less delta R0 but have a higher R0 when staying-at-home, so the result isn’t that much different.

So the upshot of some simple algebra here is daunting—if you are at R0 of 0.9 and want to stay under R0 of 1.2 you can’t afford much incremental spread, can’t afford much incremental activity.

**BUT WHAT IF R0 IS, AS PER LOS ALAMOS, IN A RANGE CENTERED ON 5.7 (WHICH APPARENTLY EXPLAINS +33%/DAY)?**

But of course this uses R0 of 2.7, while the Los Alamos paper referenced so many times had R0 higher say 5.7.

If that is the unconstrained R0 then the situation is much much worse, as this tilts the R0 contribution of the essentials to be likely much higher and thus the incremental out-and-about from the SAH’s you can afford to stay under 1.2 is even lower.

You can play with the 10% and other assumptions here in a spreadsheet. With so little margin, there’s not much play.

**LOOKING BACK AT IMPERIAL—ITALY AND SWEDEN**

If this seems like it is a bit far fetched, then look at the R0’s implied in the Imperial College model for say Sweden, how high they are, and then how still relatively high they are even with the “intelligent” social distancing they are doing, which is, perhaps, where we are headed if the stay-at-home wears too thin and we can’t continue.

It won’t be pretty.



**WHAT ABOUT POLYNOMIAL/ALGEBRAIC SPREAD? (SORRY DOESN’T SEEM TO APPLY)**

I have written several times that in some conditions there can be polynomial or algebraic spread rather than exponential.

If that is the case, then we would have more headroom between 0.9 and 1.

But that is observed only so far in the early stages of an epidemic and in the SIR-X model of the second paper I forwarded when there was aggressive isolation, neither seen here..

**THE CURVE DOESN’T FLATTEN TO SYMMETRY—UGLY FLAW IN IHME MODEL?**

I would finally note that I have been astonished that the curves shown at the white house “stop the spread” meetings have been so crazy and unreal, that they show the curve going up and then down almost symmetrically, and down so dramatically.

This is of course not the feature of the Imperial College model, nor is it what you see happening in say Italy and elsewhere other than Wuhan.

(What is happening in Singapore with reemergence is a more troubling long term trend, what I’m taliking about here again

is rather the shape of the first wave.)

The shape of the IHME curves \*\*never\*\* made sense—the virus in the US accelerated close to +33%/day, doubling 2.6 days, and the stay-at-home was never imagined to be nearly as tight as Wuhan, not even clear it was R0 < 1 and certainly not tight enough to make a symmetric or nearly symmetric curve.

A symmetric curve fades to 0 very quickly, and is very nice politically, but certainly doesn’t reflect reality or any realistic explanation.

I finally found today, on Twitter as retweeted by Nick Silver, an explanation of this “abnormality” which might be referred to as “the tyranny of the model”.

This gets deep into probability/statistics and I haven’t verified it, nor am I readily able to, but it is certainly the case that the back sides of the curves we have been shown at the White House are overly optimistic.

Our lockdowns, far far weaker than Wuhan, and weaker even than Italy seem inevitably likely to decline slowly like Italy did or slower.
