Dear friends, family and fellow humans,



The CoVid-19 pandemic is on everyone’s mind and I have been urged to share my experiences living in China through such an unprecedented situation.



In January of this year, when the viral spread was starting to gain public attention in China and people were beginning to compare it to the outbreak of SARS in 2002, I was working in Huangshan City, Anhui, about 300 miles east of Wuhan, Hubei. On January 23, as the entire city of Wuhan was being quarantined, everyone in my small city began to understand that the situation was as dire as we all had feared. When I returned from work to my apartment complex, I saw that one of the entrances to the neighborhood had been barricaded with iron gates. Feeling that this situation was more serious than I had realized, the next morning I began my self-isolation.



I was isolated in my eighth floor apartment, with my dog, Charles Wallace, for a total of 40 days. At first, as loud speakers blared public announcements that all residents were being asked to stay indoors, I felt fear and loneliness creeping into my psychology and quickly realized that routine and mindfulness would be the key to making it through the situation with my physical and mental health intact. The routines I developed for myself helped me stay safe, positive and rational at a time when mandatory self isolation became the new normal and media sensationalism and politics seemed to cloud public discourse. That week, the private school I manage made the decision to begin online classes and my newly-opened restaurant and bar began delivery-only service—closing our doors to the public and adapting to the situation to protect our interests and the health of the general public.



For the first 20 days I slept during the day and woke late at night so I could take Charles for walks in the now abandoned riverside park next to my house without having to see-or interact with-any other people on the street and, also, so that I could more easily stay connected with my family on the other side of the world.  The west, as they refer to it here in China, was not yet visibly affected by the spread of the virus but tensions were beginning to rise. Leaving the house during that time was a harrowing affair. I developed a system for leaving the house-wearing a mask and safety glasses, donning gloves and a hat, and avoiding unnecessary contact with anything outside. Others in my neighborhood adapted quickly to the situation by providing tissues in the elevator so tenants could avoid touching the buttons and by cleaning all the surfaces in public spaces more frequently. Upon returning home, I would treat my clothes like hazardous material and be sure to excessively wash my hands before touching anything.  To be sure, it felt like I was living through a zombie apocalypse. Those days were dark, uncertain and confusing to say the least, but I slowly built a routine and learned that the virus wasn’t the only thing to fear. Boredom, a lack of physical activity, and the sense of social isolation began to take center stage in the drama that my life had become. It didn’t help that so much news and social media was increasingly negative and exaggerated.



After the first couple of weeks, I returned to a regular sleeping schedule and reinforced the daily routine that helped me to overcome the negativity that had been building up around me. At first, it was easy to get lost in the sensationalism in the news and I found myself becoming hyper-sensitive to the uncertainty of the situation, but my routine helped me stay grounded. Public schools announced widespread and indefinite closures and restaurants were told to close their doors to customers.  Luckily, my partners and I had reacted early and were ahead of this curve. I would wake up at dawn and do some basic exercises before my morning coffee. I would take this time to practice mindfulness and would absolutely avoid social media and news. I would make a big breakfast and read while I ate to keep my mind from wandering to negative thoughts. After finishing my meal, I would allow myself 15-30 minutes of media time so I could stay up to date on any new developments. It was easy to break this rule at first, but I found that the days I did limit myself were easier to bear.



I am lucky enough to have several hobbies that allowed me to stay occupied. I turned to playing guitar, producing music, painting, gardening, and playing with an attention-hungry pup. I spent the mornings rotating through these activities with an emphasis on finishing specific tasks: learn this scale, finish that song, complete this part of the painting, etc. This helped me gain a sense of accomplishment and it led to me being excited about returning to the task later on. Lunch and more reading would always be followed by more light, indoor exercise. I found that if I didn’t get my afternoon exercise it was easy to fall asleep on the sofa and waste a day, inactive. After my sit-ups, pushups and planking, I would spoil myself with some media time. This included movies, television, video games, radio and yes, even news. It was easy to binge on media at first and I found that giving myself clear limits and goals helped a lot. Before making myself dinner, I would play with Charles and continue working on his training; this offered us both a sense of accomplishment. After dinner and dishes, I would would take Charles for a walk in the dark and eerily silent park by the river because I found that this was a time when most of my neighbors were choosing to stay indoors; it gave me the opportunity to avoid running into other people. Returning home, I would follow the decontamination routine at the front door, thoroughly wash, and head to bed with my book.



Things definitely got worse before they got better. Neighborhoods closed their gates and all residents were required to register with the local government in order to leave the house. Families were allowed to send out one member of their household up to three times a week and then, only to buy food or medical supplies. Body temperatures were always collected upon entering a business and returning to the neighborhood.  Unlike Wuhan, Hubei and other more seriously affected areas, Anhui experienced far fewer cases of the virus, and grocery stores and super markets stayed open.  Taking the situation seriously, I chose to purchase an abundance of non-perishable foods online and have fresh produce delivered to my gate instead, to avoid the crowds.



Later, after about a month had passed, things seemed to be improving. The government released new tracking and monitoring applications that helped people and businesses feel safe and which allowed the government to keep a record of who was traveling where and when. I can see some of you cringing in your seats just reading about such intrusive technologies, but I have to admit that it helped settle the masses and it allowed people and business to start getting back to some semblance of normalcy. In China, people have grown comfortable with this level of control and surveillance and it was likely a major reason that the outbreak has been so well controlled to this point. In the US, people tend to fear such draconian measures and, in the end, this sense of deserved privacy and freedom may be our downfall in battling this pandemic.



Now, two months later, writing this letter from an outdoor cafe, enjoying a pint of locally- brewed IPA in Shanghai, I see that many people seem to have moved on with their lives. Travel is not so restricted and many people are returning to work. Yes, businesses are taking body temperatures at the door, collecting names and contact information and offering hand sanitizer to clients. Yes, the government, in partnership with online platforms, has implemented a system of tracking and monitoring the health condition of each resident within the country via cell phone applications. And yes, this can feel a bit invasive.



Upon entering a business, patrons are asked to show their “health code” app in order to gain access. If the customer shows a green health code, it indicates that they are low risk. If, however, anyone in that establishment turns out to be high risk, then all the customers who may have come into contact with them personally or with the surfaces they may have touched will be re-labeled as high risk and will be asked to quarantine for up to 14 days.  Again, this can feel like some sort of dystopian surveillance state, but it has also allowed people to feel comfortable leaving their homes and returning to a more normal life. It has allowed the nation to breath a collective sigh of relief-feeling like the worst of times are behind us.



I would prefer to avoid bringing politics into this discussion as this is a global pandemic that would more aptly be described as a human issue as opposed to one of national or political concern. That being said, and especially in my homeland, the voices of the people can create change and fuel flames that may not be possible in other systems of government.



This is a human issue, a global medical emergency. Moving forward, each person will have to take responsibility for their health and the health and well-being of others, and be responsible for monitoring their contacts and condition. It will need to be businesses who also implement monitoring and control mechanisms to limit the spread of this virus once things begin to get better. And they will get better.



My advice; take this thing seriously. Stay home. Practice social isolation. WASH YOUR HANDS. And perhaps most importantly, stay positive. Be mindful of your mental health and find creative ways to get the exercise you need to stay physically healthy. Stay in touch with your friends, family and loved ones and listen to medical experts. This is not a time to gain political credit or point fingers at others. Instead, let’s all come together, metaphorically, and do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable amongst us.



To all my friends, family and countrymen, stay strong, stay vigilant, and remember that we are fighting this battle together. Together, we will overcome.



From one human to another,



Scot
