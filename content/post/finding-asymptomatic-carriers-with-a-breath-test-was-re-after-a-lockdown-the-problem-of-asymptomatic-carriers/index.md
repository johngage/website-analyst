The percentage of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic carriers with COVID-19 is very large. Anecdotally, some have said asymptomatic might be 20% of cases, which I used in the note yesterday, included below. Further information from recent reporting indicates mild and asymptomatic might be even higher, around half.

I wrote, as below and previously, of the need for widespread temperature testing to find infected and otherwise non-compliant individuals, and the need to order a LARGE amount of temperature screening equipment ASAP. But if many of such asymptomatic/mild people don’t have fevers this will leave us searching for them after they create asymptomatic chains, requiring enormous logistical manpower and with probably limited success with contact tracing which will be extraordinarily difficult to impossible, especially if >>20% such cases.\
\
A wonderful additional tool to find people without temperatures would be a breath test—having machines (or very very large numbers of trained dogs :-)) which people would have to breathe into (or for the dogs, perhaps, near) to be able to check whether they are infected and asymptomatic.\
\
A Google search this a.m. shows that, indeed, such an approach has been thought of and might be possible.

> A common feature of the inflammatory response in patients who have actually contracted influenza is the generation of a number of volatile products of the alveolar and airway epithelium. These products include a number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitric oxide (NO). These may be used as biomarkers to detect the disease. A portable 3-sensor array microsystem-based tool that can potentially detect flu infection biomarkers is described here. Whether used in connection with in-vitro cell culture studies or as a single exhale breathalyzer, this device may be used to provide a rapid and non-invasive screening method for flu and other virus-based epidemics.

I strongly suggest this and things like it be pursued as an urgent matter, as we will need all the help we can get dealing with the asymptomatic carriers. If this works we will need LOTS AND LOTS of such devices.



We should also try to figure out how this can be done in a supply-less yet sterile way. Perhaps the machine could have a negative pressure opening you breathe into, without contact the machine, i.e. you exhale sharply in its direction, without consuming a sanitizing cover. It might still need to be cleaned occasionally, perhaps by including a strong UV-C light source in the machine so this cleaning similarly would not require supplies.



Best, Bill



PS For those who want a deeper understanding of many of the issues about controlling the continuing spread of COVID until we can put up some substantial resistance (e.g. with prophylaxis, herd immunity or vaccination) I re-recommend this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?​v=gxAaO2rsdIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs).



PPS It is the case that even things which provide little marginal benefit are of huge benefit when herd immunity, to a novel pathogen, is so low. So we now see reports of people trying giving Flu and other vaccines which may provide only a small amount of benefit on a percentage basis, but large compared to the very very low herd immunity. This is also the reason that wearing masks is so important. Yes we want them to go first to first responders, health care workers and other exposed workers in the critical infrastructure, but providing everyone with a simple mask will help us all, especially when we haven’t yet deployed strong tools for weeding out the asymptomatic- and mildly-symptomatic people from general circulation.
