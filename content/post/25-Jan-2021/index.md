In my TED talk now more than a dozen years ago https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_joy_what_i_m_worried_about_what_i_m_excited_about
I talked about pandemic preparedness and noted that we have little experience with pandemics, and thus don't have good intuition for them.

So while I am glad to now see some discussion of the risk of the emergence resistant strains of COVID in the press, I find it troubling that some clear relationships that would seem to greatly affect the scale and timing of this risk and the resultant public policy implications to mitigate it are substantially missing, at least from the main discussions that I have heard and read.

I therefore share these notes. As this is not my field, perhaps much of this is more widely known than is apparent. If so, I hope that the relevant recommendations reach, from such authorities, the public policy makers.

I would welcome pointers to further readings on the topics I touch on here, especially ones which suggest that things are, for whatever reason, less bad than the sequel may imply, or which provide additional suggestions and opportunities for mitigation.

Best, Bill

### THOUGHTS ON THE SHAPE OF COVID-19 IMMUNE ESCAPE RISK AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS

Bill Joy<br>
January 25, 2021

THIS IS EFFECTIVELY A DISEASE WITH A VECTOR

COVID’s asymptomatic carriers make this essentially a “disease with a vector”,
e.g. like a mosquito-borne disease.
Diseases with vectors don’t have a strong incentive to evolve to be less deadly,
as they aren’t prevented from spreading when their victims are disabled (e.g. not ambulatory).
This means COVID evolution poses a substantial continuing threat not only of further pandemics,
but also ones with substantially increased morbidity and mortality.

**FACTORS DRIVING RELATIVE RISK OF THE EVOLUTION TOWARD IMMUNE ESCAPE**

The rate of mutation toward immune escape, at any point in time, is proportional to how many cases of infection there are, and, separately, amplified by the selective advantage of such a mutation because it can infect a greater percentage of the population, including otherwise resistant people-- this incremental advantage ratio increases dramatically as the percentage of resistant population increases.

So, for example, if half the population is immune to the current strain, the relative advantage can be as much as a factor of 2 (if no immunity to the new strain). The resulting factor of 2 increase in infectiousness can make a dramatic difference as, for example, a previous Rt of 0.8 (dying away) could become 1.6 (running away). We see this pernicious math with e.g. the British strain, but not because of immune escape—
this is a separate problem of a similar or worse scope (said differently, the British strain has a higher R0, immune escape, for the same R0, gives a higher Rt).

With the current situation of a high number of cases and rising herd immunity
the advantage of immune escape is thus rising quickly and substantially and will only decline when there are substantially less cases or a much broader immunity e.g. from broader spectrum vaccines.

**DANGER IN THE DATA FROM THE FIELD**

That we are seeing materially significant mutations emerge in the wild now implies
that the number of cases is above a critical threshold,
and, probably also, that enough time has elapsed for accumulation of mutations,
to generate a threshold of mutations allowing material change in the progress of the pandemic. The more variants which have and seem likely now to emerge and gain a foothold for rapid spread, the great the risk that one or more of these escapes or provides a better platform for further escape than the current strain.

**THE LANDSCAPE TOWARD ESCAPE—PLATFORMS**

The progress toward immune escape can be gradual—a partially escaping variant
can gain fitness, and thus enabled to spread better, can provide a platform for further stepwise escape. The emergence of a set of substantive mutations which are necessarily advantaged but which do not escape may yet find some of them turning out to be closer to escape, (it would be a surprise if there were no such variance in a population of new variants) and thus move us closer to a full or additionally partial escape from existing vaccine or infection-acquired immunity.

**SACRIFICING ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS**

A newly evolved and fitter variant may be able to give up some of the
fitness advantage from asymptomatic carriers if the total delta advantage is otherwise material.
If this process goes too far, the disease will lose its “vector" character,
which would then hopefully help bias further evolution toward, ambulatory allowing, strains.

**AFFECTING PREVIOUSLY UNAFFECTED GROUPS**

A slightly different effect is that the British or other new strains
may also have gained fitness by incremental infectiousness
in previously less impacted demographic groups such as the young
which would affect measures which need to be taken
e.g. make keeping schools open much more difficult.

STRAINS LIKE THE BRITISH STRAIN MOVE THE ENDPOINT OUT

Absent the more infectious strains like the British strain, and because, at least in the US,
of the effective segregation of the population into compliant and non-compliant subgroups.
My previous analysis suggested that we were nearly, in the non-compliant subgroup,
sufficiently immune that the pandemic might have begun to abate there
and thus across the whole population
in the next couple of months even without vaccination.

That is, if 30% of the population were immune, it is I think the case that most of this 30%
is concentrated in the rough half of the population that hasn’t been complying with or has been unable to comply with protective advice. Thus this rough half subgroup might
have not 30% but >50% immunity. I believe we are (were, because of the new strains) thus closer that thought, not to full herd immunity, but to abatement due to the pandemic slowing in this subgroup.

This potential good news is now canceled by the emergence of more contagious strains
which threaten to overwhelm our precautions even in the compliant subgroup
and have sufficient power to increase the spread e.g. even if that subgroup has e.g. >50% immunity.

##### POLICY IMPLICATIONS

1. **HOLDING DOWN THE NUMBER OF CASES IS KEY TO REDUCING THE RISK OF ESCAPE**

Holding down the number of cases before vaccination is critical to reducing the risk of immune escape, which can occur anywhere and then distribute globally.

2. **AGGRESSIVELY VACCINATING FULLY GLOBALLY IS IN OUR OWN SUBSTANTIAL RATIONAL SELF-INTEREST**

While we may be able to vaccinate enough in the first world and even give boosters
to hold down the localized risk of immune escape, the new, more contagious, strains will also accelerate into the less developed world and, if immunity there is not acquired substantially through vaccination, the global risk of succeeding waves from new immunity-resistant strains will greatly increase. This implies we all have a substantial interest in limiting the number of true cases in the world, and should work to vaccinate globally as aggressively as possible, in our own rational self-interest.

**3. AGGRESSIVELY DEVELOP BROAD SPECTRUM VACCINES**

It will also be key to try to develop broader spectrum vaccines which prevent foreseeable immune escapes and then, after vaccinating everyone globally with the first available vaccines, continue by revaccinating with these broad spectrum vaccines
to attempt to block additional pandemics e.g. in the winters (eg 2021-2022 / 2022-2023) to come.


Whatever such a program might cost it is hard to see how it can even faintly compare
to the cost of another pandemic in, say, the Winter of 2021-2022 or 2022-2023, so time here and global coordination is of the essence.

This is worthy of an aggressive “Transwarp” program (a different name may be preferred--
(but see e.g. if of interest discussion of fictional warp vs transwarp in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_drive.)

4. **FIT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WITH REUSABLE / HOME CLEANABLE MASKS**

We should also work to fit everyone with a medical grade reusable (simply cleanable, long lasting) mask, as masks are a tool which will work against respiratory transmitted virus strains that have not yet emerged, even and especially ones we have not imagined and thus not prepared vaccines for.
To make sure to reach everyone, especially in Africa, it will be necessary, as noted by Larry Brilliant, to flood the market with such masks so there is no black market/resale but instead everyone has one.
