My name is Bill Joy. As a venture capitalist I was involved, in 2006, in the creation of the KPCB Pandemic fund, which attempted to use venture capital innovation to prepare for pandemics, including starting a company which was working to provide surge ventilator capacity. [https://venturebeat.​com/2006/02/15/kleiner-​perkins-surprises-with-200-​million-pandemic-fund/](https://venturebeat.com/2006/02/15/kleiner-perkins-surprises-with-200-million-pandemic-fund/)

I have also written about these kinds of dangers in the popular press. I have watched with alarm over the last few weeks as the West (Italy, US etc) has ignored the lessons from China (and to a lesser extent Korea) and is proceeding down a path that is not known to work and which the Chinese quickly abandoned. We do this at our peril.

Consider the study just published by the NY Times.\
[https://www.nytimes.com/​interactive/2020/03/20/us/​coronavirus-model-us-outbreak.​html?action=click&module=​Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-model-us-outbreak.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)\

This shows disastrous outcomes except under “severe” control. The severe control is described, somewhat implicitly here, as "testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts”\
Understanding what was done in Wuhan, it is easy to read between the lines on this.\
\
Nearly two weeks ago the statistics department at Harvard circulated the attached preprint (my son is a student there and sent it to me). This paper gave me the chills and I have been trying since to raise the alarm. The paper describes what the Chinese did. It’s hard for non-statisticians to read. But it’s key to understanding that what we are doing right now is not what the Chinese did and, if the paper is correct (and I have no reason to doubt it) and I am reading it correctly, that the most aggressive things we are doing or are in the conversation didn’t work in Wuhan in the period up to February 2 and likely won’t work here. \
\
The key is that actions which turned the outbreak was much more aggressive than the things currently being done in Italy etc. Only after February 2 did the Chinese government do what was ultimately successful and is likely needed and unimplemented elsewhere. The absolutely key chilling sentence from the extracted paragraph below from the paper attached is

> On February 2, with improvement in medical resources, the government implemented the policy of centralized quarantine and treatment of all confirmed and suspected cases, those with fever or respiratory symptoms, as well as close contacts of confirmed cases in designated hospitals or facilities. Meanwhile, temperature monitoring and stay-at-home policies were implemented to all residents in the city.

Anything less, such as families just staying home, etc. has failed, as in Italy, to stop the continued spread in a society with city-like connection and interaction as in Wuhan. Such actions may help the hospitals from being as overloaded, but, absent useful vaccines or new therapies, will only delay and not change the outcome.\
\
The problem is that doing “some” without doing “strict” causes the "community spread" phase to proceed to what the Chinese observed—an explosion of family cases—"family spread” where the member of a family shelter together and often infect each other in close quarters, spiking the number of cases. We have just implemented, in a number of states, a situation which will similarly explode the cases. This family spread phase leaves you with lots of asymptomatic carriers which then circulate at large to do the shopping etc., so eg if there are 2 adults and 2 children in your household at least one of the adults is \~\~75% likely to be asymptomatic if both get infected, with total probability higher. With the asymptomatic family members preferentially doing the shopping, and imperfect compliance with spacing and contact spread and the high R0 of this virus, the virus continues to spread with an R0 still > 1. I strongly believe this is what is happening in Italy, further infecting the community. The Chinese noticed this “some control” (family isolation) strategy wasn’t working and quickly abandoned it. WE NEED TO QUICKLY ABANDON THIS ALSO.\
\
The NY Times has had excellent reporting on what the Chinese did instead. You “fever test”—you take temperatures of people everywhere as they move about the city, and send those with fevers to fever tents, where they get a white blood cell test and presumptive flu test. If those indicate you have the flu or a bacterial infection then, presumably to save resources, you let the person go. Otherwise you use a portable cat scan machine to do a presumptive test for the lung characteristics typical of these infections, which machines can do purportedly 400 or so patients a day. If you fail this test, then you are given a PCR and sent to a hotel or other isolated place to wait where you won’t get infected if that turns out to be negative, but can’t circulate to infect others. If at the end of this you are positive, you are segregated from the rest of the community. THIS STRICT REGIMEN IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WUHAN-LIKE AND TERRIBLE OUTCOMES. IT IS KNOWN TO WORK.\
\
I understand how hard it is to do this because it isn’t being widely practiced or even in the “conversation” in the West. That such action is far beyond what is being done outside of perhaps China and Korea, is to our and others collective peril.\
\
Until I see us amassing us marshaling the resources to do what the Chinese did I believe we will fail. Given what I know now, and absent a strongly effective prophylactic or vaccine arriving delivered by aliens tomorrow, I believe any strategy which doesn’t include a large contactless thermometer order and the other organizational and material aspects of the testing so as to do what was done in Wuhan we are overwhelming likely to continue, as in Italy, to failure and a very very bad outcome.\
\
Regretfully but with hope for a new strategy,\

PS Here’s a bit more of an extract:

> To better reflect the dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic and corresponding interventions, we classified the outbreak into four periods based on important dates that could affect the virus transmission (Fig. 1). The time before January 11, 2020, the first date of Chunyun (massive migration for the Chinese New Year), was considered as the first period when no intervention was imposed. The second period referred to the Chunyun of January 11-22, 2020, when massive population movement occurred and was expected to accelerate the spread of Covid-19. No strong intervention was imposed except for the announcement of human-to-human transmission and infections in healthcare workers on January 20. The hospitals started to be overcrowded with people with fever or respiratory symptoms. During the third period between January 23 and February 1, the local government first blocked all outbound transportations on January 23 and subsequently suspended public transit and banned all vehicular traffic within the city. Other social distancing measures were also implemented, including compulsory mask-wearing in public places and cancellation of social gathering. Due to severe shortage of medical resources in this period, many confirmed or suspected cases could not receive timely treatment and were self-quarantined at home. On February 2, with improvement in medical resources, the government implemented the policy of centralized quarantine and treatment of all confirmed and suspected cases, those with fever or respiratory symptoms, as well as close contacts of confirmed cases in designated hospitals or facilities. Meanwhile, temperature monitoring and stay-at-home policies were implemented to all residents in the city. Taken together, we divided the outbreak in Wuhan into four periods (before January 11, January 11-22, January 23-February 1, and February 2-18, 2020, respectively) with specific intervention activities provided in Fig. 1.
